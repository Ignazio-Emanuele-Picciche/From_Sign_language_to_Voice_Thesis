--7E2sU6zP4_10-5-rgb_front	15.22	And I call them decorative elements because basically all they're meant to do is to enrich and color the page.
--7E2sU6zP4_11-5-rgb_front	23.57	So they don't really have much of a symbolic meaning other than maybe life is richer, life is beautiful, but they've become so beautifully stylized and so you find them in different illuminative being rendered in very different ways.
--7E2sU6zP4_12-5-rgb_front	14.56	Now this is very, this is actually an insert of a kind of an envelope for stationary, and this is a very Italian design.
--7E2sU6zP4_13-5-rgb_front	6.01	This is all the you know, take off on the idea of the acanthus leaf.
--7E2sU6zP4_5-5-rgb_front	8.84	It's almost has a feathery like posture to it.
--7E2sU6zP4_6-5-rgb_front	16.77	And so, it's used in architecture as a decorative element in architecture on columns and so on, and it's also used a great deal in illumination.
--7E2sU6zP4_7-5-rgb_front	12.05	And so what's happened with the idea of acanthus leaf, is that it has is taken on all these different creative looks.
--7E2sU6zP4_8-5-rgb_front	15.18	And it has been wildly colored so you can look at some an acanthus leaf and you can start with the idea of a black and white drawing.
--7E2sU6zP4_9-5-rgb_front	9.97	Here, actually, I have some samples of traced acanthus leaves from different illuminated manuscripts.
--8pSDeC-fg_0-5-rgb_front	0.62	Hi.
--8pSDeC-fg_1-5-rgb_front	2.12	My name is Dr. Art Bowler.
--8pSDeC-fg_10-5-rgb_front	6.67	Are you always focused on the positive aspects of your physical self instead of the negative?
--8pSDeC-fg_11-5-rgb_front	2.5	If so you have high self esteem.
--8pSDeC-fg_12-5-rgb_front	10.42	Low self esteem tends to bring us down and there's a set of thoughts or cognitions that tend to go with low self esteem.
--8pSDeC-fg_13-5-rgb_front	5.46	Such as I am unlove, unlovable and no one will like me.
--8pSDeC-fg_14-5-rgb_front	19.42	By doing cognitive therapy and working on those thoughts, we can help our clients to feel better about themselves by gaining a more accurate appraisal of themselves, their situation and their environment.
--8pSDeC-fg_15-5-rgb_front	6.17	It's really important to notice if you have low self esteem because then you can do something about it.
--8pSDeC-fg_16-5-rgb_front	5.29	This is Dr. Art Bowler and this has been how to tell if you have low self esteem.
--8pSDeC-fg_2-5-rgb_front	5.75	And I'm a psychologist in Manhattan, New York City, where I have my own private practice.
--8pSDeC-fg_3-5-rgb_front	5.96	In this clip I'm going to talk about how to tell if you have low self esteem.
--8pSDeC-fg_4-5-rgb_front	6.96	Low self esteem or a low feeling about oneself is unfortunately very common.
--8pSDeC-fg_5-5-rgb_front	3.0	But fortunately it's very fixable.
--8pSDeC-fg_6-5-rgb_front	4.92	When one has low self esteem, the way you can tell is look in the mirror.
--8pSDeC-fg_7-5-rgb_front	2.04	How do you feel about yourself?
--8pSDeC-fg_8-5-rgb_front	1.33	What do you see?
--8pSDeC-fg_9-5-rgb_front	5.79	Do you see the positive parts of your personality or do you notice the negative?
-00cp1iGiDw_1-5-rgb_front	5.26	If you like to find more about my services you can visit my website canineheadstart.com.
-00cp1iGiDw_10_11-5-rgb_front	16.6	So that is one option. Another option is if you know your dog has fleas there is something called cap star and this is a product that is oral product.
-00cp1iGiDw_12-5-rgb_front	16.6	It works right away and it will actually kill all of the fleas that are on the dog for the next 24 hours and it start working in about 30 minutes.
-00cp1iGiDw_13-5-rgb_front	22.48	So if you taken your dog to a place or a friends house or to a training school and you believe that there are fleas there and your dog may have gotten fleas this is a great product to use when you are about to leave before you bring your dog to your home.
-00cp1iGiDw_14-5-rgb_front	8.63	Again this is a oral preventive and this is also a oral preventive.
-00cp1iGiDw_15-5-rgb_front	8.43	We are going to be talking about external flea prevention in the next video.
-00cp1iGiDw_2-5-rgb_front	7.09	So we are going to be talking about flea prevention in this short video clip.
-00cp1iGiDw_3-5-rgb_front	12.35	There are a number of products out there that you can use on your dog obviously one way to prevent fleas is not have you dog go out side but that is not really realistic.
-00cp1iGiDw_4-5-rgb_front	5.63	So we are going to be talking about products that you can use to prevent fleas.
-00cp1iGiDw_5-5-rgb_front	7.88	In the last of couple of years there has been a increase of different types of options out there that you can use.
-00cp1iGiDw_6-5-rgb_front	8.43	I'm just going to talk about three of the ones that are most commonly used and seems to be more effective.
-00cp1iGiDw_7-5-rgb_front	24.15	So there is something called sentinel and this is a monthly tablet and sentinel actually prevents not only fleas but heart worm as well and the come individually wrap packages.
-00cp1iGiDw_8-5-rgb_front	34.66	The dogs typically like to eat them they are flavored so they chew them right up and what this does is it prevents the production of cottin so if a flea jumps on your dog bites your dog and ingest the blood meal then the blood meal would have the chemical ingredients of the sentinel when they lay there eggs they would not be able to produce cottin.
-00cp1iGiDw_9-5-rgb_front	12.43	cottion is the excess scalp of a flea so it doesn't kill the fleas but it prevents them from infesting or reproducing in your home.
-06_nJnhORg_0-5-rgb_front	18.14	Some of the days that are the hardest are when, you know, I start out first thing in the morning and things just, like I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or...or whatever, you know, type of phrase you want to use.
-06_nJnhORg_1-5-rgb_front	3.84	But things just don't go right from the very beginning.
-06_nJnhORg_10-5-rgb_front	7.38	I have lots of clients that want cleaning done Thursdays and Fridays, because they want it done right before the weekend.
-06_nJnhORg_11-5-rgb_front	3.75	So Thursdays are really jam-packed.
-06_nJnhORg_12-5-rgb_front	13.22	I've got three very big jobs, three very big houses that have, you know, three and four bathrooms, and, just large houses...so, that makes for a really long day.
-06_nJnhORg_13-5-rgb_front	6.97	And, I had one of those days where I just woke up and things just didn't want to go my way.
-06_nJnhORg_14-5-rgb_front	5.42	So I...I continued to fight through it, fight through it...didn't feel real great.
-06_nJnhORg_15-5-rgb_front	8.55	So, got in the car, got to the first job, everything went, you know, okay....I was good, but I was still a little bit late.
-06_nJnhORg_16-5-rgb_front	10.39	So, got to the next job, and, you know, moving right along, and I go out to get some cleaning supplies out of my car, and it's locked.
-06_nJnhORg_17-5-rgb_front	16.77	And I go to get my keys out of my little supply box, and they weren't in there, so, I, you know, look around for my keys, and, sure enough, they are locked in my car and I have no extras.
-06_nJnhORg_18-5-rgb_front	8.26	I have none at home, I have no extras, cause I have an extra key in my car, and I have my remote in my car.
-06_nJnhORg_19-5-rgb_front	2.88	And, so, that was kind of tough.
-06_nJnhORg_2-5-rgb_front	19.23	You get a late start, you, you know, get to the house and it's an extra big mess, and, you know, you just....one thing after the other just leads to a tough day of...of a long tough day working.
-06_nJnhORg_20-5-rgb_front	12.3	So, I, you know, I had to just fight through the cleaning, and had to have a lock-smith come out and open my doors, and I had to go to another job.
-06_nJnhORg_21-5-rgb_front	14.35	So, you know, sometimes when things just don't go your way...you know, you just have a rough day, and you go to bed that night and you hopefully wake up the next morning and.. and it's all better.
-06_nJnhORg_3-5-rgb_front	15.52	Generally, I...I will schedule two to three houses a day, and if I get a late start then, you know, of course, that just delays the next job, and then the next job, and then it can be seven or eight at night when I get home.
-06_nJnhORg_4_5-5-rgb_front	23.98	And one thing that I like...I try not to do is to interfere with my client's family time as well. So, when I get a late start, and maybe I have a horrendous house that I had to clean and...and wasn't planning on it, then my day gets later and I start to intrude into their family time.
-06_nJnhORg_6_7-5-rgb_front	10.39	And...and that makes it tough for me, I don't...I don't like to do that at all. So that's probably the hardest part, is, if I don't start my day right.
-06_nJnhORg_8-5-rgb_front	9.18	So, I kind of have to mentally prepare myself for my day, so, that's probably the hardest day for me, is not preparing myself.
-06_nJnhORg_9-5-rgb_front	2.67	One of my toughest days are Thursdays.
-08ZGCviCm4_0-5-rgb_front	8.09	Hello welcome my name is Julio Nutt and I am a master instructor of the Jim McLean Golf School in Miami, Florida.
-08ZGCviCm4_1-5-rgb_front	6.97	In this clip I am going to talk about a great drill that is really going to help you to shift your weight forward.
-08ZGCviCm4_2-5-rgb_front	8.59	In golf you have got to learn to shift your weight forward in order to hit the ball and transfer your weight into your left side.
-08ZGCviCm4_3-5-rgb_front	17.81	But many amateurs when hitting the ball they hang to the right side, they get their arms really close and tight to their bodies and they have a lot of difficulty transferring their weight into their left side.
-08ZGCviCm4_4-5-rgb_front	16.43	Just using a shaft would be a great drill to use because when we're throwing something forward we're throwing a Frisbee, if we're throwing a ball the natural motion is to throw the weight with it.
-08ZGCviCm4_5-5-rgb_front	9.55	So right now I'm not going to think about hitting the golf ball, I'm going to think about throwing the shaft.
-08ZGCviCm4_6-5-rgb_front	13.81	So I'm going to get in my golf position and as I swing I am going to let the shot go as hard as I can and that is really going to help me develop the habit of throwing my weight.
-08ZGCviCm4_7-5-rgb_front	3.38	That is a great tip that I give to a lot of my students.
-08ZGCviCm4_8-5-rgb_front	8.68	When hitting the ball think about throwing the club and that is going to generate extension and weight transfer.
-08ZGCviCm4_9-5-rgb_front	3.09	This is Julio Nutt at the Jim McLean Golf School.
-0BynF9TSNI_1-5-rgb_front	10.05	Today I'm going to take you back into time and I'm going to show you one of my grandmother's favorite things to make the kids and that was sweet bruschetta.
-0BynF9TSNI_10-5-rgb_front	8.3	This recipe what my grandmother use to do this and I hope you enjoy it, I hope you make it, it's really fun and fast.
-0BynF9TSNI_11-5-rgb_front	1.67	The kids will love you for it.
-0BynF9TSNI_12-5-rgb_front	6.17	I'll show you the ingredients, utensils it's literally 15 minutes and it's done.
-0BynF9TSNI_13-5-rgb_front	1.08	I hope you make it.
-0BynF9TSNI_2-5-rgb_front	9.34	Sweet bruschetta is just the mixing of different things chopped up and baked in the oven.
-0BynF9TSNI_4-5-rgb_front	5.96	But today we're going to show you one for the kids and especially the big kids like me.
-0BynF9TSNI_5-5-rgb_front	1.42	I mean this is nice.
-0BynF9TSNI_6-5-rgb_front	4.21	You're going to use a whole bunch of things like bananas is the main thing.
-0BynF9TSNI_7-5-rgb_front	5.59	When you put in beneath that flame, it glazes and just comes out spectacular.
-0BynF9TSNI_8-5-rgb_front	3.13	I'm going to show you all the ingredients of this recipe.
-0BynF9TSNI_9-5-rgb_front	4.46	This is at least 60, 70s years old I think.
-0FA6OhxZSE_0-5-rgb_front	0.96	DAVID CLEMEN: Hi.
-0FA6OhxZSE_10-5-rgb_front	8.68	I'm left-handed but I played sports with right, so I do squeegee with the right hand.
-0FA6OhxZSE_11-5-rgb_front	2.96	And so, that's squeegeeing the second color.
-0FA6OhxZSE_2-5-rgb_front	4.88	Alright, now that I've plopped my white paint, I'm going to pick up my favorite tool again.
-0FA6OhxZSE_3-5-rgb_front	3.55	And I'm just going to come in here and just kinda fill it out.
-0FA6OhxZSE_4-5-rgb_front	34.45	And now, when you mix the red and white in big areas, if it's too much red and you don't move it fast enough, you'll start to get pink so I want to try and keep the integrity of the white and I'm just going to move that fast, and see how--I don't know if you can see it, but since the paint has kind of dried quickly on this paint on the wood, it's already created a texture underneath of it.
-0FA6OhxZSE_5-5-rgb_front	5.13	So, now, I'm getting this texture of the paint underneath of it.
-0FA6OhxZSE_6-5-rgb_front	9.47	So, I'm just going to come in here and do these big squeegee marks and not going to go too crazy with it.
-0FA6OhxZSE_7-5-rgb_front	3.8	And I'm not trying to cover up all the red.
-0FA6OhxZSE_8-5-rgb_front	10.47	I'm just trying to get certain areas and show the white on the top of the red.
-0FA6OhxZSE_9-5-rgb_front	13.22	And then, I can come in and I can actually just do almost like, I guess you would say it's like almost a karate chop or samurai swing to the right or left.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_0_1-5-rgb_front	10.88	In this clip we're going to talk about how to buy a trophy. Most people will come into my show room and they'll ask me how much is a twenty inch trophy.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_10-5-rgb_front	5.62	So when it comes to buying a trophy, it's not how tall it is for the dollar.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_11-5-rgb_front	2.58	It's really, what you get for your dollar.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_2-5-rgb_front	7.08	And I say to them we don't sell trophies by the inch, and I give them this fine example here.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_3-5-rgb_front	2.33	This is a forty-eight inch trophy.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_4-5-rgb_front	7.67	If you go to any trophy store and they can offer you this forty-eight inch trophy for as little as $20.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_5-5-rgb_front	8.67	As you can see, if you were to buy a trophy by the inch, someone could sell you this and you wouldn't be very happy with it.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_6-5-rgb_front	11.38	So my recommendation is not to try and buy a trophy based on how tall it is but take into consideration the materials that it's made of.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_7-5-rgb_front	5.46	We use marble bases that are imported directly from Italy.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_8-5-rgb_front	9.33	We also put little felt dots on the bottom of the trophies and that keeps them from scratching your furniture when you get home.
-0JdYlTf9Y8_9-5-rgb_front	6.71	A lot of times people will try and save money in building a trophy by leaving out these little things.
-0N0jbyBW6g_0-5-rgb_front	0.63	Hello.
-0N0jbyBW6g_1-5-rgb_front	4.34	We're going to be speaking about cross stitch craft kits today.
-0N0jbyBW6g_10-5-rgb_front	1.71	My name is Daniel King.
-0N0jbyBW6g_11-5-rgb_front	0.67	Thank you.
-0N0jbyBW6g_2-5-rgb_front	7.17	My name is Daniel King, and I'm an experienced pattern maker, designer and sewer.
-0N0jbyBW6g_3-5-rgb_front	8.17	Cross stitch craft kits are kits that you can order through many craft stores or art supply stores.
-0N0jbyBW6g_4-5-rgb_front	3.96	These kits allow you to do different designs.
-0N0jbyBW6g_5-5-rgb_front	11.68	What the kit incorporates is a fabric background, usually the different colored threads, and a hoop for hooping and taut, to make the fabric taut.
-0N0jbyBW6g_6-5-rgb_front	11.34	With these designs you can make, typically, any type of plaque, maybe stockings for Christmas, or even portraits.
-0N0jbyBW6g_7-5-rgb_front	13.64	It allows you to take these different threads and stitch one through the fabric and to follow along the design to create whatever design it is.
-0N0jbyBW6g_8-5-rgb_front	11.85	These kits are available in most craft stores, and it gives you some flexibility as to what kind of designs you like.
-0N0jbyBW6g_9-5-rgb_front	5.21	Again, we're talking about cross stitch....cross stitch craft kits.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_0-5-rgb_front	2.63	This is Robert Stewart, with Hill13.com.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_1-5-rgb_front	20.48	Now, we're going to talk about some advanced tactics, and the importance of employing all that you've learned in terms of individual drilling, and all of the basic tactical awarenesses and skills you need to have, to function as a highly effective player.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_2-5-rgb_front	6.59	When you get into advance tactics, you're talking about a lot of teamwork.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_3-5-rgb_front	29.82	You're talking about everyone on your team, having those individual skills down, and being able to use them in concert with one another, so we're going to be going over the taking of buildings, the defending of buildings, and the critical elements required tactically, to integrate a team together, and have them function as a single system, with a goal, where everyone on the team is working together.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_4-5-rgb_front	5.59	A lot of what's required, is stressing the importance of communication.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_5-5-rgb_front	4.8	It's stressing the importance of maintaining your situational awareness.
-0ZqnVFv7eI_6-5-rgb_front	15.64	Knowing what's happening with your other team members at all times, and inside of the shifting dynamics, having the tactical skills necessary, to support, defend, and be aggressive, at the same time.
-0daC3SWCPQ_0-5-rgb_front	0.5	Hello!
-0daC3SWCPQ_1-5-rgb_front	1.88	We are Terry and Laura Neven.
-0daC3SWCPQ_10-5-rgb_front	7.42	When you teach your children at home, it allows you a greater opportunity to have time as a family.
-0daC3SWCPQ_11-5-rgb_front	6.38	One important reason for the benefit of home schooling is academic success.
-0daC3SWCPQ_12-5-rgb_front	10.72	Researh says that the average home school child is 1 to 2 grades levels above their public or private school peers.
-0daC3SWCPQ_13-5-rgb_front	6.84	These are just some of the wonderful benefits why families home school.
-0daC3SWCPQ_2-5-rgb_front	7.05	I am the administrator of California educators and principal of Sunland Christian School.
-0daC3SWCPQ_3-5-rgb_front	4.17	This clip we will talk about the benefits to home schooling.
-0daC3SWCPQ_4-5-rgb_front	18.56	Many families begin to home school not because of concerns of academics or because of concerns of the local public or private school because they are concerned about things relative to the family.
-0daC3SWCPQ_5-5-rgb_front	4.8	Home schooling can provide a great opportunity for family unity.
-0daC3SWCPQ_6-5-rgb_front	4.46	To do things together, to learn together and to grow together.
-0daC3SWCPQ_7-5-rgb_front	7.84	In specifically Southern California there is a lot of issues relative to a flexibility of schedule.
-0daC3SWCPQ_8-5-rgb_front	5.92	It is important to understand that home schooling allows for great flexibility.
-0daC3SWCPQ_9-5-rgb_front	6.51	Moms are already running around like chickens with their heads cut off, taxing kids here and there.
-0oP2H0vAGY_1-5-rgb_front	7.05	"This is a great ""who dun it"" guessing game and you should use a minimum of 6-8 people."
-0oP2H0vAGY_10-5-rgb_front	5.13	When the murderer chooses they will choose a victim and kill them.
-0oP2H0vAGY_11-5-rgb_front	9.8	How they will do that is by shaking their hand and doing a little tickle inside.
-0oP2H0vAGY_12-5-rgb_front	11.89	So just scratching the inside of the hand but doing it very discreetly so that no one else sees when the victim has been killed.
-0oP2H0vAGY_13-5-rgb_front	13.39	They have to shake three more hands just so that it's not obvious who killed them and then they get to choose a way they want to die nice, and big, and dramatic.
-0oP2H0vAGY_14-5-rgb_front	15.35	"So if I was to kill David ""hi, how are you"", he's going to shake three more hands and on the third hand die."
-0oP2H0vAGY_15-5-rgb_front	19.85	"""Aahh"", good, then we have our victim dead lying on the floor and the rest of us have to try to figure out who killed him."
-0oP2H0vAGY_16-5-rgb_front	8.34	Now again only the person running the game and the person that's dead knows, but the person that's dead can't say anything.
-0oP2H0vAGY_17-5-rgb_front	55.14	"So you vote and the majority wins so whoever you want to, its kind of a witch hunt at this point, you just pick and choose who you think might look suspicious and if that person actually is indeed the murderer lets say you say ""ah"", everyone agrees it was Joe, the person running the game knows if its Joe or not if it was Joe they say ""yes, you guys have won"", if its not they just say ""nope, that is not the murderer"", and you just, Joe has to die though and then the games goes again and again until either the murderer is killed every body off without being killed themselves or until they've been found out by the crowd."
-0oP2H0vAGY_18-5-rgb_front	1.63	And that's how you play murderer.
-0oP2H0vAGY_2-5-rgb_front	1.84	The more the merrier.
-0oP2H0vAGY_3-5-rgb_front	3.67	What you do one, is choose one person who is just going to run the game.
-0oP2H0vAGY_4-5-rgb_front	18.06	They don't actually get to participate, so if you are playing this with kids maybe if you have an adult in the room they could choose to be the one running the game or just maybe an adult that doesn't feel like playing if its a group of adults they can run the game.
-0oP2H0vAGY_5-5-rgb_front	11.22	Basically, they are going to have all the adults close their eyes or kids close or cover your eyes and the person running the game will choose one person to be the murderer.
-0oP2H0vAGY_6-5-rgb_front	3.88	They just choose them by tapping them gently on the head.
-0oP2H0vAGY_7-5-rgb_front	5.55	That person is the murderer only they know it and the person running the game knows it.
-0oP2H0vAGY_8-5-rgb_front	3.71	Everybody's eyes open and the game begins.
-0oP2H0vAGY_9-5-rgb_front	10.01	"You just start walking around the room shaking everybody's hands with a nice greeting ""hi, how are you"", ""hi, how are you""."
-0sphqZT1eQ_1-5-rgb_front	6.55	Today I'm going to teach you how to become a competitive baseball player.
-0sphqZT1eQ_2-5-rgb_front	7.09	In this segment we're going to demonstrate batting practice with live pitching.
-0sphqZT1eQ_3-5-rgb_front	12.14	Now as oppose of the machine, the machine pitches automatic fastballs and an automatic curve balls going from one angle to one angle only.
-0sphqZT1eQ_4-5-rgb_front	18.81	Life pitching determines more of a simulated angle of the game as the pitchers as hitters are seeing pitchers from various arm angles to where they can adjust to improve there hitting.
-0sphqZT1eQ_5-5-rgb_front	8.05	This makes to be a more effective hitting practice regiment than the machine.
-0sphqZT1eQ_6-5-rgb_front	4.05	The machine is mainly for timing for fastballs.
-0sphqZT1eQ_7-5-rgb_front	12.18	But as opposed to the live pitching you get various angles, live angles from an actual pitcher when hitting the ball.
-0sphqZT1eQ_8-5-rgb_front	13.35	Normally for a lefty, you would set this type of a L cage at this and have balls being thrown by a left handed pitcher on this end.
-0sphqZT1eQ_9-5-rgb_front	7.84	You can flip the machine over (flip the cage over) in order to throw the ball right handed.
-0yRaqY7nTE_0-5-rgb_front	0.5	Hi.
-0yRaqY7nTE_1-5-rgb_front	1.79	My name is Daniel Baldwin.
-0yRaqY7nTE_10-5-rgb_front	16.1	We also tow them, so if it's very inoperable and, or you just don't want to drive it in, you can have us come in and we'll tow the vehicle, then you can bring later in that title and we pay at that time.
-0yRaqY7nTE_2-5-rgb_front	4.55	I'm the general manager from Kurt's Auto Wrecking in American Fork, Utah.
-0yRaqY7nTE_3-5-rgb_front	4.8	And today we're giving you information on selling your junk car in Tampa.
-0yRaqY7nTE_4-5-rgb_front	9.84	Now the best thing you can do first of all is to clear your car out with all the stuff that you would like and take your license plates off.
-0yRaqY7nTE_5-5-rgb_front	4.92	Now next, there's many companies that you can sell your vehicle to.
-0yRaqY7nTE_6-5-rgb_front	12.43	In order to find those type of companies, you can get in the phone book and search, look under recycling centers or scrap yards or salvage yards.
-0yRaqY7nTE_7-5-rgb_front	27.78	Or, you can also go onto a web search like Google and type in any of those keywords again, and they will be able, and you'll pull up a bunch of scrap metal companies or recyclers, and they will be able to help you to find somewhere to sell those vehicles that are no longer operable or you just don't want anymore, and they're not worth a bunch of money.
-0yRaqY7nTE_8-5-rgb_front	15.93	Now, the best thing to do, again, is to have your title with you, and do not fill it out until you become on site so that we don't have any paperwork issues, and they're not any signatures in the wrong lines.
-0yRaqY7nTE_9-5-rgb_front	4.67	And you come in and we pay you cash at the time you drop it off.
-1KpdDGPCq4_0-5-rgb_front	3.5	All right, the drink we're about to make is called San Juan Cooler.
-1KpdDGPCq4_1-5-rgb_front	2.25	Let's go ahead and put some ice in a glass.
-1KpdDGPCq4_2-5-rgb_front	7.42	And measure out two ounces of rum.
-1KpdDGPCq4_3-5-rgb_front	4.0	And follow that up with three fourths of an ounce of dry vermouth.
-1KpdDGPCq4_4-5-rgb_front	3.42	And we'll just fill it up with pineapple juice.
-1KpdDGPCq4_5-5-rgb_front	41.83	And let's get our spoon, so if you find yourself in San Juan and the temperature is really getting to you, just really need something that's going to quench your thirst and cool you down, and at the same time maybe loosen you up a little bit, you can order the San Juan Cooler, or if you're just in a bar in Northern Idaho and decide you'd like a nice cocktail, you can order a San Juan Cooler there as well.
-1KpdDGPCq4_6-5-rgb_front	10.55	Let's go ahead and garnish that with an orange and a cherry and that's it, bottoms up.
-1PeVdIwiq0_1-8-rgb_front	2.29	Today we're going to be talking about buying a new car.
-1PeVdIwiq0_10-8-rgb_front	11.0	So just because a brand new car has never been titled, doesn't necessarily mean that you can't end up with a brand new car that has been titled and save yourself a bunch of money.
-1PeVdIwiq0_11-8-rgb_front	11.29	So find out whether you are really a new car buyer or maybe you're a used car buyer with the same model year with a few miles on it so that you can save yourself some money.
-1PeVdIwiq0_12-8-rgb_front	11.12	You can save upwards of 5 to 10 and even sometimes 20 thousand dollars on buying a new used car versus buying a brand new car without an MOS.
-1PeVdIwiq0_13-8-rgb_front	4.04	So find out whether or not you're really a new car buyer.
-1PeVdIwiq0_14-8-rgb_front	4.42	When it comes to buying a new car, remember, its ok to say no.
-1PeVdIwiq0_15-8-rgb_front	5.0	Just 'cause they ask you to pay a certain amount of money for a car, doesn't mean that you have to.
-1PeVdIwiq0_16-8-rgb_front	5.04	Sometimes the best tactic to buying a new car is getting up and leaving.
-1PeVdIwiq0_17-8-rgb_front	13.33	If they say they can't sell you the car and they really can't, then they won't, but there's no reason why you can't come back tomorrow and try again, but if they come chasing you out the door and they say ok ok we want to sell you the car, then you can feel like you got a good deal.
-1PeVdIwiq0_18-8-rgb_front	6.88	When buying a new car, don't be afraid to ask your dealership to allow them to allow you to look at the invoice.
-1PeVdIwiq0_19-8-rgb_front	9.33	That's what they paid for the car and nine times out of ten, the dealership will be willing to share that information with you in order for you to make an educated decision.
-1PeVdIwiq0_2-8-rgb_front	2.92	In this segment we're talk about negotiating on a new car.
-1PeVdIwiq0_20-8-rgb_front	8.12	If you know how much they paid for a car, then you're willing to offer them a little bit more than what they paid for the car, usually they'll be willing to sell it to.
-1PeVdIwiq0_21-8-rgb_front	11.5	Also remember that when buying a new car, depending on how many days its been in their inventory, they may be motivated to sell that particular car than not.
-1PeVdIwiq0_22-8-rgb_front	8.71	So don't be afraid to ask if you can purchase the car that is many days in stock so that they'll be willing to give you a better car deal.
-1PeVdIwiq0_23-8-rgb_front	6.29	Remember, just because buying a car at invoice is what the dealership does, doesn't mean you have to.
-1PeVdIwiq0_24-8-rgb_front	6.75	You can always buy the car for below invoice, especially if that dealership's had that car in stock for more than 300 days.
-1PeVdIwiq0_25-8-rgb_front	2.04	Remember, don't be afraid to ask.
-1PeVdIwiq0_26-8-rgb_front	1.96	Negotiating is why you're there.
-1PeVdIwiq0_3-8-rgb_front	4.75	Its easy to buy a new car, 'cause they'll either tell you yes you can buy it for that, or no you can't.
-1PeVdIwiq0_4-8-rgb_front	4.0	The manufacturers is the one that determines what the car costs.
-1PeVdIwiq0_5-8-rgb_front	7.12	The dealership buys the car from the manufacturer and there are many websites out there that tell you what the actual cost of the car is.
-1PeVdIwiq0_6-8-rgb_front	7.46	Once you determine how much that car costs, its up to the dealership whether to sell you the car for that, for less than that, or for more than that.
-1PeVdIwiq0_7-8-rgb_front	10.38	Depending on the desirability of that new car, which means how hot it is in the market, that's exactly what's going to determine whether you get a great deal on your new car purchase or not necessarily a great deal.
-1PeVdIwiq0_8-8-rgb_front	7.38	Always remember that the difference between a new car and a used car is that a new car has an MSO, which is the Manufacture Certificate of Origin.
-1PeVdIwiq0_9-8-rgb_front	5.92	The minute that you purchase that new car though, it becomes titled and then it becomes a used car.
-1Uik-vwQoc_0-5-rgb_front	8.51	I'm Cooie Grey-Lavin and in this clip, I'll show you how to use unique headstones to customize your yard.
-1Uik-vwQoc_1-5-rgb_front	10.89	Another way to add interest to your yard, in our family we make little headstones for all our dogs that have died.
-1Uik-vwQoc_2-5-rgb_front	3.17	This particular one is our Golden Retriever.
-1Uik-vwQoc_3-5-rgb_front	4.42	Scooter, so that's his name in old typeset.
-1Uik-vwQoc_4-5-rgb_front	2.54	These are the colors that were in his collar.
-1Uik-vwQoc_5-5-rgb_front	12.47	He was a Golden Retriever, so we have that and he also loved to chase raccoons and he had chased one a short time before he died, so we put a raccoon in it.
-1Uik-vwQoc_6-5-rgb_front	10.51	That you can place around the yard, it's a simple mosaic stepping stone technique but we just added some different pieces to make it more interesting.
-1Uik-vwQoc_7-5-rgb_front	9.72	You can add memorial plaques or plaques for members of your family that are, don't live there and you miss them to sort of remembrances.
-1Uik-vwQoc_8-5-rgb_front	3.38	They add a nice personal touch to your yard.
-1Uik-vwQoc_9-5-rgb_front	6.92	Adding a mosaic headstone to your yard can make more personal and unique.
-1XUnputrgk_0-5-rgb_front	4.46	Okay, another thing that for me is important.
-1XUnputrgk_1-5-rgb_front	1.5	It may not be for you.
-1XUnputrgk_10-5-rgb_front	2.34	Feel free to get the.
-1XUnputrgk_11-5-rgb_front	3.17	You have little masks, they're just paper masks.
-1XUnputrgk_12-5-rgb_front	2.96	You can get them at Home Depot or Lowes.
-1XUnputrgk_13-5-rgb_front	2.5	And they're actually called painters masks.
-1XUnputrgk_14-5-rgb_front	5.88	Some of them are just made of paper.
-1XUnputrgk_15-5-rgb_front	2.34	But they're very affordable.
-1XUnputrgk_16-5-rgb_front	4.63	You can get a pack of, you know, several for just a couple of dollars.
-1XUnputrgk_17-5-rgb_front	2.13	So make sure you.
-1XUnputrgk_18-5-rgb_front	3.34	If you have those, keep them in here on hand.
-1XUnputrgk_19-5-rgb_front	2.29	You know, it protects your health when you're cleaning.
-1XUnputrgk_2-5-rgb_front	5.42	But for me I use very strong chemicals.
-1XUnputrgk_20-5-rgb_front	5.26	You don't have to worry about any hazardous chemical getting into your system.
-1XUnputrgk_21-5-rgb_front	3.67	And it just makes the whole process a lot safer for you.
-1XUnputrgk_22-5-rgb_front	4.5	And for your children if you have children that help out cleaning around the house.
-1XUnputrgk_23-5-rgb_front	3.38	So I would recommend having a mask on hand.
-1XUnputrgk_3-5-rgb_front	5.59	Some people may prefer to use products that don't have chemicals.
-1XUnputrgk_4-5-rgb_front	4.71	But because I do, I enjoy having the disinfectants.
-1XUnputrgk_5-5-rgb_front	4.84	I like to wear a mask while I'm cleaning.
-1XUnputrgk_6-5-rgb_front	3.21	Because you don't need to be breathing those chemicals in.
-1XUnputrgk_7-5-rgb_front	2.75	Especially you know when, I'm pregnant.
-1XUnputrgk_8-5-rgb_front	2.88	A lot of women, a lot of you out there.
-1XUnputrgk_9-5-rgb_front	3.42	And men too that clean bathrooms.
-1eulcDdoVQ_0-5-rgb_front	12.47	And with that, we have our completed awards show menu, and just in time, because it looks like the pre-show is just ending.
-1eulcDdoVQ_1-5-rgb_front	3.42	So, let's go over what we've got here.
-1eulcDdoVQ_10-5-rgb_front	15.93	If it is in place of a meal, however, you want to have--bank on five to seven different appetizers, and again, two to three per person.
-1eulcDdoVQ_2-5-rgb_front	16.68	We started with our phyllo tartlets with the ricotta, and sundried tomato, and feta, and goat cheese inside--really, really delicious.
-1eulcDdoVQ_3-5-rgb_front	6.59	Then, we did our puff pastry cheese straws, which you see how it sort of draws your eye up.
-1eulcDdoVQ_4-5-rgb_front	21.27	You've got very short, small bites of the little smoked salmon canapes, which is a nice contrast in height to the puff pastry cheese straws arranged in this vase, just with some decorative rocks in the bottom.
-1eulcDdoVQ_5-5-rgb_front	30.03	"And then of course we go to the smoked salmon canape, with some creme fraiche which is very creamy, and then the saltiness of the fish, and the nice nutty flavor and texture of the--this so-called ""European bread""--which you can then take a little lemon juice to."
-1eulcDdoVQ_6-5-rgb_front	25.9	And then we finish with our fricos, our parmesan crackers with mache, that baby lettuce, and served in an alternate way in the martini glass with just the same parmesan crisp, but not in the arced format.
-1eulcDdoVQ_7-5-rgb_front	8.22	So just another guideline to keep in mind: how do you know how many appetizers to make for your party?
-1eulcDdoVQ_8-5-rgb_front	11.97	If it's not during a mealtime, you want to have at least two to three kinds of appetizers, so in this case, we've got the four.
-1eulcDdoVQ_9-5-rgb_front	7.67	But at least two to three kinds, and bank on two minimum per person for your party.
-1fUFbij2s0_0-5-rgb_front	3.17	LAURA BANFORD: Now, I'm going to talk about knife sharpening.
-1fUFbij2s0_1-5-rgb_front	13.68	An interesting part about a sharp knife or a knife that's not so sharp is it is much easier to cut yourself with a dull knife than it is with a sharp knife.
-1fUFbij2s0_10-5-rgb_front	9.05	I happen to have this sharpening stone little system here that has three, three stones on it.
-1fUFbij2s0_11-5-rgb_front	5.76	This is a coarse stone for major sharpening tasks.
-1fUFbij2s0_12-5-rgb_front	6.17	This is a medium stone which will give you a more refined sharpening task.
-1fUFbij2s0_13-5-rgb_front	6.84	And this is a fine sharpening stone just to touch up your blade a little bit.
-1fUFbij2s0_14-5-rgb_front	6.34	I sharpen my knives just about every day.
-1fUFbij2s0_15-5-rgb_front	11.34	And I sharpen knives when I'm at work, I sharpen my knives before every task, so I don't have to stop in the middle and go back and sharpen it.
-1fUFbij2s0_16_17_18-5-rgb_front	10.55	This is a sharpening steel. This does not sharpen your knife. This will refine your blade, but it won't sharpen your knife.
-1fUFbij2s0_19_20_21_22-5-rgb_front	17.35	After you sharpen your knife, you use this. And I'll show you that at the end. Okay. What I want to do here is to get, to get a nice edge on my knife.
-1fUFbij2s0_2-5-rgb_front	22.19	Now, if you're working with a dull knife, it's not cutting, it's not cutting, you're going to use a lot more pressure, a lot more force, and not use--and get away from the actual technique that you should be using for whatever task you're doing, and that's when you end up cutting yourself.
-1fUFbij2s0_23_24-5-rgb_front	12.01	You want to hit, take your knife and hit the sharpening stone at a 45 degree angle. That is about like this.
-1fUFbij2s0_25-5-rgb_front	14.1	And you have to, you'll have to try it to get it right, but you have to perfect your technique 'cause you want to go from the base of the knife near the guard all the way to the tip.
-1fUFbij2s0_26_27_28-5-rgb_front	23.23	Like that. Whatever you do one way, you have to do the other way because you're making an edge. And try to make sure you have the 45 degree angle.
-1fUFbij2s0_29-5-rgb_front	2.29	You would do that for a little while.
-1fUFbij2s0_3-5-rgb_front	1.38	That's when accidents happen.
-1fUFbij2s0_30-5-rgb_front	7.3	You might, you might go from coarse to fine just to refine your edge.
-1fUFbij2s0_31-5-rgb_front	13.35	And after that, you want to use your sharpening steel, which is really just refining the edge.
-1fUFbij2s0_32-5-rgb_front	2.96	You see chefs do this.
-1fUFbij2s0_33-5-rgb_front	2.92	That's just refining the edge.
-1fUFbij2s0_34-5-rgb_front	11.3	The same as with the sharpening stone, whatever you do to one side, you have to do to the other side, that's why you go like this.
-1fUFbij2s0_35-5-rgb_front	4.8	And as in anything, practice makes perfect.
-1fUFbij2s0_36-5-rgb_front	4.34	When we come back, we're going to use some of our knives.
-1fUFbij2s0_37-5-rgb_front	0.38	See you then.
-1fUFbij2s0_4-5-rgb_front	11.09	If you're pushing and using more force and straying away from the actual perfect technique, you're going to cut yourself, and I've done that.
-1fUFbij2s0_5-5-rgb_front	5.05	I don't want to tell you about the frozen turkey Thanksgiving morning.
-1fUFbij2s0_6-5-rgb_front	6.63	That's an old--that was a long time ago, and I still remember it.
-1fUFbij2s0_7-5-rgb_front	1.58	Believe me.
-1fUFbij2s0_8-5-rgb_front	5.59	The way to sharpen a knife is to use a sharpening stone.
-1fUFbij2s0_9-5-rgb_front	8.93	A lot of chefs would buy a couple of sharpening stones in various degrees of coarseness.
-1rM0t5FMiE_0-5-rgb_front	2.0	We're doing the scissoring now.
-1rM0t5FMiE_1-5-rgb_front	3.25	There are two types of scissors that I like to use.
-1rM0t5FMiE_2-5-rgb_front	12.35	The straight pair of scissors that are straight and long and then curved pair of scissors that help with around the feet and areas like that.
-1rM0t5FMiE_3-5-rgb_front	12.05	First I'm going to straighten up her leg, to where I position the leg where I want it and then I'm going to go down the backside of the leg.
-1rM0t5FMiE_4-5-rgb_front	19.73	And if your dog tends to move, you might want to hold your dog this way and just and you go around the leg and take off the little pieces that are sticking out everywhere.
-1rM0t5FMiE_5-5-rgb_front	5.51	It makes for a nice little leg here.
-1rM0t5FMiE_6-5-rgb_front	22.27	And then we're going to go around to the front area of the leg and I'm going to go take the round scissors and round off the bottom and clean it up nice.
-1rM0t5FMiE_7-5-rgb_front	15.77	Remove the hair and pull her leg up and keep finishing with the little pieces of hair that are sticking out here and there.
-1rM0t5FMiE_8-5-rgb_front	2.88	It makes for a nice scissor leg.
-23PZTqtDBw_0-5-rgb_front	2.29	Off-season training for football.
-23PZTqtDBw_1-5-rgb_front	3.29	Isolated plank dog pointers.
-23PZTqtDBw_10-5-rgb_front	17.39	So we are going to work one side of the body, and then we will work the other side of your body, and we want to follow a rep scheme of anywhere from ten reps to fifteen reps per side.
-23PZTqtDBw_11-5-rgb_front	3.42	Again that is ten reps to fifteen reps per side.
-23PZTqtDBw_12-5-rgb_front	6.92	For the bigger guys it is going to be a bit harder I know, but still try to stay with it.
-23PZTqtDBw_13-5-rgb_front	7.72	It is really going to help with your stability and coordination and balance on the field.
-23PZTqtDBw_14-5-rgb_front	17.02	And then after we finish with this exercise, when we come back and start the workouts all over again with workout one, you are going to have a lot more stability and balance to help develop more power.
-23PZTqtDBw_15-5-rgb_front	3.46	So thanks a lot for joining us here, I appreciate it.
-23PZTqtDBw_16-5-rgb_front	4.55	I am mike Rosengart and this is my workout partner Jonsey.
-23PZTqtDBw_17-5-rgb_front	3.75	Check us out again online and have a good workout.
-23PZTqtDBw_2-5-rgb_front	0.42	Okay?
-23PZTqtDBw_3-5-rgb_front	26.03	So this is the last exercise in our isolated series, working from the dumbbell rows to the hops to the lateral hops, forward hops, and now we are going to do plank position, and we are going to do dog pointers, which is the same exercise that we did in our previous workout, but this time we are going to do it isolated.
-23PZTqtDBw_4-5-rgb_front	3.92	We are going to stick with one side, we are going to add another variability into it.
-23PZTqtDBw_5-5-rgb_front	3.13	So Jonsey go ahead, pop up into your plank position.
-23PZTqtDBw_6-5-rgb_front	8.05	We are going to get the elbow and the knee to touch underneath your body each time, and then get the full extension out.
-23PZTqtDBw_7-5-rgb_front	2.67	So touch and full extension out.
-23PZTqtDBw_8-5-rgb_front	0.42	Alright?
-23PZTqtDBw_9-5-rgb_front	15.31	This is really going to put focus on shoulder stability of the off shoulder and off hip, at the same time working for balance and coordination and mobility through your torso as you are working.
-3bw4dQEyF8_0-5-rgb_front	9.51	You know, a medical emergency in an infant, can be a pretty scary and traumatic process, for a parent or a rescuer.
-3bw4dQEyF8_1-5-rgb_front	7.72	Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni, and what I'm going to talk about, is how to stop choking in the infant victim.
-3bw4dQEyF8_2-5-rgb_front	14.1	The infant victim must first be placed in the rescuer's arm, supporting the head, and chest area on the forearm.
-3bw4dQEyF8_3-5-rgb_front	10.89	Find a place where you can sit with the victim, placing them head down, and supporting the head.
-3bw4dQEyF8_4-5-rgb_front	14.26	You will then deliver a series of five back blows, and five chest thrusts, in succession, so it would be one, two, three, four, five.
-3bw4dQEyF8_5-5-rgb_front	17.73	Roll the victim over, supporting the head and body, on the other forearm, and deliver five chest thrusts, in succession, until the object has been dislodged.
-3bw4dQEyF8_6-5-rgb_front	20.27	After a series of five back blows, and chest thrusts, if it has not been dislodged, then repeat the process, of back blows and chest thrusts, until the item is dislodged from the infant.
-3bw4dQEyF8_7-5-rgb_front	1.21	I'm Captain Joe Bruni.
-3bw4dQEyF8_8-5-rgb_front	2.54	Stay safe, and we'll see you next time.
-3sFcDBFxc8_0-5-rgb_front	2.42	All right, we're ready to start our fire.
-3sFcDBFxc8_1-5-rgb_front	11.64	What I always like to have nearby is my blower, just in case it needs a little extra air and oxygen to get moving.
-3sFcDBFxc8_10-5-rgb_front	8.47	But you see you can insert these a lot further, rather than having a hand held lighter and trying to get your hand in there.
-3sFcDBFxc8_11-5-rgb_front	2.54	Or even using matches and throwing those.
-3sFcDBFxc8_12-5-rgb_front	1.42	And these tend to work better.
-3sFcDBFxc8_13-5-rgb_front	3.25	We'll go ahead and see if its not too windy.
-3sFcDBFxc8_14-5-rgb_front	1.92	We've got a flame in there.
-3sFcDBFxc8_15-5-rgb_front	1.58	It looks like its catching.
-3sFcDBFxc8_16-5-rgb_front	5.59	Can definitely see smoke, and where there is smoke there is fire.
-3sFcDBFxc8_17-5-rgb_front	3.5	Hopefully you can see the smoke on there, and it looks like it is catching real well .
-3sFcDBFxc8_18-5-rgb_front	5.8	And make sure that you stand outside of the line of the smoke, you wouldn't want to be breathing in the smoke.
-3sFcDBFxc8_19-5-rgb_front	4.42	So here we've got the startings of our bon fire.
-3sFcDBFxc8_2-5-rgb_front	6.26	I don't think its going to be an issue today since we've got a nice little bit of wind coming at us.
-3sFcDBFxc8_3-5-rgb_front	7.3	And that speaks to the next point of wich area should you light first.
-3sFcDBFxc8_4-5-rgb_front	4.71	Well, you should light all around the fire, two, three, four spots if you can.
-3sFcDBFxc8_5-5-rgb_front	11.64	But what we want to do is we want to light where the wind is coming from because that's going to give us a better chance of getting it catching fire, catching all of it on fire.
-3sFcDBFxc8_6-5-rgb_front	3.29	Maybe we won't have to light it in different spots around.
-3sFcDBFxc8_7-5-rgb_front	4.71	You'll actually be able to tell once you actually get it in there and get it lit.
-3sFcDBFxc8_8-5-rgb_front	4.34	So I'm going to go ahead and dip down here, and hopefully you can see this.
-3sFcDBFxc8_9-5-rgb_front	6.3	And I'm just going to light it, and it might take a couple of times to get the lighter going.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_0-3-rgb_front	9.42	I like to put the glue bottle down sideways like this because it?s a little bit quicker, you don't have to let the glue run all the way down like when you put it upright.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_1-3-rgb_front	9.38	Take a brush, little glue brush just like this, and spread this glue out very very thoroughly.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_2-3-rgb_front	3.54	Make sure you get all the way to the end.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_3-3-rgb_front	1.25	Cover everything.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_4-3-rgb_front	7.92	And you don't want a whole lot of sloppy glue running everywhere but you do want to have enough to completely coat all the parts.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_5-3-rgb_front	2.96	And then we'll brush it out a little bit.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_6-3-rgb_front	2.71	That looks pretty good.
-4Sl9mPOlfA_7-3-rgb_front	3.88	Set that down and we're going to do the same thing to this side.
-6PULg1jlpc_0-5-rgb_front	3.96	O.k., perfect we're going to get started in a second.
-6PULg1jlpc_1-5-rgb_front	5.84	"I know a lot of ladies out there are wondering, ""How do I get my skin clean?"
-6PULg1jlpc_10-5-rgb_front	10.22	We don't want to sleep all night with makeup on our skin, because this can cause breakouts and acne on the skin.
-6PULg1jlpc_11-5-rgb_front	5.88	So make sure to use a good cleansing product when removing makeup.
-6PULg1jlpc_12-5-rgb_front	8.47	Makeup is something that all women love to use but we also need to remember to remove it properly.
-6PULg1jlpc_13-5-rgb_front	9.93	Simply apply the cleanser or cream to your hands and apply it to the face and begin rubbing.
-6PULg1jlpc_14-5-rgb_front	6.76	Now remember, getting rid of that makeup you might have to cleanse twice.
-6PULg1jlpc_15-5-rgb_front	5.51	So don't be afraid to go back over your face again a second time.
-6PULg1jlpc_16-5-rgb_front	7.47	Remember, cleansing your skin is very easy and you can do it yourself at home.
-6PULg1jlpc_17-5-rgb_front	8.72	My name is Sylvia Russell and this is how you can clean your skin and get rid of makeup.
-6PULg1jlpc_2-5-rgb_front	2.17	"How do I get rid of this makeup?"""
-6PULg1jlpc_3-5-rgb_front	2.84	Well, today I'm going to show you how.
-6PULg1jlpc_4-5-rgb_front	8.51	My name is Sylvia Russell and today we're going to show you how to clean your face and get rid of makeup.
-6PULg1jlpc_5-5-rgb_front	12.76	Now make sure that you have the proper products
-6PULg1jlpc_6-5-rgb_front	7.34	Make sure you have water and you have a towel or some paper towels and cotton to help you clean up.
-6PULg1jlpc_7-5-rgb_front	5.17	So what you're going to do is go ahead and begin to wash your face.
-6PULg1jlpc_8-5-rgb_front	11.72	Now remember, cleansing the skin is something that can be very easily done at home, and it's something that you want to do on a regular basis.
-6PULg1jlpc_9-5-rgb_front	2.84	Removing makeup is vital.
-6PZkp-zC78_0-5-rgb_front	4.17	Hi, I'm Stan DeFreitas, Mr. Green Thumb for On Gardening.
-6PZkp-zC78_1-5-rgb_front	2.92	Now this is a petunia variety called Wave.
-6PZkp-zC78_2-5-rgb_front	6.76	And you can see the reason it's called Wave because it tends to just lap over every area.
-6PZkp-zC78_3-5-rgb_front	18.64	Now there's a bunch of different kinds of petunias, which we've talked about in the past in different things, but the Wave Petunia is one that you'll find great for a hanging basket, or as a bedding plant where you want it to spill over into another area.
-6PZkp-zC78_4-5-rgb_front	12.85	The Wave Petunias will flower just about every day, and they'll give you a bunch of flowers from early Spring through Fall, depending on where you're at.
-6PZkp-zC78_5-5-rgb_front	10.22	Now petunias are fairly heavy feeders, so I'd make sure that you give it about every week or two about half strength with a good water soluble plant food.
-6PZkp-zC78_6-5-rgb_front	6.26	You might also when you plant them, make sure it's got good peat and pearl like combination.
-6PZkp-zC78_7-5-rgb_front	6.76	Many of the good mixes that are professional mixes will be good for this particular plant.
-6PZkp-zC78_8-5-rgb_front	12.68	Remember in baskets, they tend to dry out a little bit quicker, so if you've got a hanging basket like this one is, you're going to have to make sure that you water it on almost a daily basis.
-6PZkp-zC78_9-5-rgb_front	3.63	For On Gardening, I'm Stan DeFreitas, Mr. Green Thumb.
-6YYqn8lplg_1-5-rgb_front	7.13	Running tumbling is going to be a great way for the whole entire squad to show off their tumbling skills.
-6YYqn8lplg_10-5-rgb_front	6.92	We're going to have a second group of tumblers facing diagonal on the right hand side.
-6YYqn8lplg_11-5-rgb_front	3.8	Then you're going to designate which side is going to go first.
-6YYqn8lplg_12-5-rgb_front	7.92	They're going to do their running, their round-off back handspring, all the way till you land.
-6YYqn8lplg_13-5-rgb_front	3.8	And then you need to continue stepping off your floor.
-6YYqn8lplg_14-5-rgb_front	5.26	Now it's really important for these to go really fast for them to be effective.
-6YYqn8lplg_15-5-rgb_front	6.46	So as soon as you see the person cross in front of you, you want to start with your run.
-6YYqn8lplg_16-5-rgb_front	4.71	And it's going to be really great because we're going to have a lot of building momentum.
-6YYqn8lplg_17-5-rgb_front	9.51	We're going to have someone go with the handspring, someone go with the handspring tuck, someone go with the handspring full, someone go with the double layout full.
-6YYqn8lplg_2-5-rgb_front	5.38	Now granted, every squad is going to have tumblers of different levels.
-6YYqn8lplg_3-5-rgb_front	10.18	A lot of squads are going to have people who can just do the round-off back handspring
-6YYqn8lplg_4-5-rgb_front	14.22	Now when you're doing your running tumbling, usually you want to make sure you can get as much distance as you can, as much run, and it's all going to start off with the round-off back handspring.
-6YYqn8lplg_5-5-rgb_front	2.71	That's where we're going to get all of our momentum from.
-6YYqn8lplg_6-5-rgb_front	11.55	Now if the round-off back handspring is the highest skill you've mastered, that's wonderful, and you're going to go ahead and be the first person to go on your squad.
-6YYqn8lplg_7-5-rgb_front	7.22	Usually what we try to do is build the tumbling from the lowest level all the way up to the highest level.
-6YYqn8lplg_8-5-rgb_front	7.38	Now the most common tumbling pattern that we're going to use on cheerleading squads is what we like to call the X.
-6YYqn8lplg_9-5-rgb_front	6.84	We're going to have a group of tumblers in line, facing diagonal on the left hand side.
-6vHGMCTYyI_0-5-rgb_front	4.59	Alright, we've taken a look at what it is that you're good at.
-6vHGMCTYyI_1-5-rgb_front	10.01	What skills you have and your educational background, so it's time to take a look at your work experience.
-6vHGMCTYyI_10-5-rgb_front	2.09	What did you get out of that?
-6vHGMCTYyI_11-5-rgb_front	13.85	What did you learn from that job or from that work experience that will help you with you new employer, will help you get a job.
-6vHGMCTYyI_12-5-rgb_front	5.88	That's how you have to think about in terms of past work experience.
-6vHGMCTYyI_2-5-rgb_front	3.63	What kind of jobs have you had before?
-6vHGMCTYyI_3-5-rgb_front	7.92	Maybe you've just had college type jobs that maybe weren't necessarily career jobs.
-6vHGMCTYyI_4-5-rgb_front	6.97	"Or maybe you have had some, feel like of a better word, ""real jobs""."
-6vHGMCTYyI_5-5-rgb_front	4.34	What you want to do is take a look at that work experience.
-6vHGMCTYyI_6-5-rgb_front	2.17	What did you gain from it?
-6vHGMCTYyI_7-5-rgb_front	4.38	Did you, you know, gain problem solving skills?
-6vHGMCTYyI_8-5-rgb_front	3.13	Did you gain customer service skills?
-6vHGMCTYyI_9-5-rgb_front	3.63	"Don't just think in terms of ""well I worked here""."
-6xQU_WIlh4_5-5-rgb_front	21.69	So that's how I'm going to be packing my books, and my CD's, since I have them in these containers here, I'm probably going to keep them in these containers so that I don't have to use up another box, and because they are pretty heavy just as they are right now, in these things.
-6xQU_WIlh4_6-5-rgb_front	14.22	And I'm going to just put a piece of tape, or a rubber band, around it, around this case vertically to keep my CD's from coming out of the box.
-6xQU_WIlh4_7-5-rgb_front	5.34	And so those are some ideas on how to pack your books and your CD's.
-70D86eMmIc_0-5-rgb_front	0.63	YOLANDA VANVEEN: Hi.
-70D86eMmIc_10-5-rgb_front	2.79	There's not a lot that originate from the East Coast.
-70D86eMmIc_11-5-rgb_front	17.23	There are some but we have a lot of Mountain Lilies and Brodiaea, which is also called Triteleia, the Camassia, we have Bear Grass, we have all types of plants that you can find all around the world now.
-70D86eMmIc_12-5-rgb_front	1.88	Next stop, South America.
-70D86eMmIc_13-5-rgb_front	27.53	Ismene or Peruvian Daffodil is a plant we sell in the summertime that's from Peru where the Incas developed it, so I like to think here we are 10,000 years later or 20,000 years later still enjoying a plant that their civilization created for us.
-70D86eMmIc_14-5-rgb_front	2.46	They're beautiful, beautiful plants.
-70D86eMmIc_15-5-rgb_front	7.76	My favorite location for where plants grow, especially bulbs is South Africa.
-70D86eMmIc_16-5-rgb_front	10.18	There's a small area on the cape that produces 20% of all the bulbs that ever grown in the whole world.
-70D86eMmIc_17-5-rgb_front	24.11	We enjoy Freesia, Gladiolus, Calla Lilies, Watsonias, everything, Eucomis from South Africa, and we don't even realize an area the size of the Portland metropolitan area produced all those plants.
-70D86eMmIc_18-5-rgb_front	6.92	Next, watch the second part on our discussion of the native areas for flower bulbs.
-70D86eMmIc_2-5-rgb_front	4.88	I wanted to talk about where in the world do flower bulbs come from.
-70D86eMmIc_3-5-rgb_front	11.05	I'm always fascinated that there's really only a few regions in the world that all of the flower bulbs that you see in your garden actually originated from.
-70D86eMmIc_4-5-rgb_front	9.18	We're in North America right here and the bulbs that I sell were on the Pacific West Coast.
-70D86eMmIc_5-5-rgb_front	20.15	I'm in Kalama, Washington, just north of Portland, Oregon, and I sell a few native bulbs that are from our area like the Triteleias which are little purple blue flowers and Camassia, also called Camas root.
-70D86eMmIc_6-5-rgb_front	11.59	Camas, Washington was named after that plant, and the natives used to eat the little corms just like you eat hazelnuts or beer nuts.
-70D86eMmIc_7-5-rgb_front	22.77	There are lots of other plants that come from America too, Liatris or Gay-feather is from the Midwest, and then we go down to Mexico and I have Canna Lilies, Tigridias, Mexican Feather Grass, pretty much any plant.
-70D86eMmIc_8-5-rgb_front	3.17	Most bulbs are from mountainous regions.
-70D86eMmIc_9-5-rgb_front	6.51	So, everywhere all the way from the Cascades down through Mexico, you'll find most bulbs.
-7BtY3iQIdo_0-8-rgb_front	6.92	Now, we're going to trim the edge of the opening of the ballet slipper with some little pearls.
-7BtY3iQIdo_1-8-rgb_front	3.58	And, we're going to pipe the pearls with a number four tip.
-7BtY3iQIdo_10-8-rgb_front	1.88	So, you want to put pressure.
-7BtY3iQIdo_11-8-rgb_front	1.75	Release pressure and pull up.
-7BtY3iQIdo_12-8-rgb_front	2.71	Squeeze, release and pull up.
-7BtY3iQIdo_13-8-rgb_front	8.75	Practice this on a piece of paper or a paper plate until you have a nice uniform pearl trim.
-7BtY3iQIdo_14-8-rgb_front	3.12	And, then we'll move onto the cake.
-7BtY3iQIdo_15-8-rgb_front	6.38	So, we're going to trim the edge where the white and the pink meet with this pearl border.
-7BtY3iQIdo_16-8-rgb_front	8.92	And, you're going to place them right on that border and go all the way around the cake.
-7BtY3iQIdo_17-8-rgb_front	8.5	Remember, you're just holding the tip just slightly above the cake so that the frosting will come out and spread a little into a little circle.
-7BtY3iQIdo_18-8-rgb_front	3.42	Releasing pressure before you pull up.
-7BtY3iQIdo_19-8-rgb_front	3.75	This makes a nice delicate trim for the edge of the slipper.
-7BtY3iQIdo_2-8-rgb_front	2.08	It's just a regular writing tip.
-7BtY3iQIdo_20-8-rgb_front	6.21	When you finish the beading around the around the shoe, you want to make a little bow here.
-7BtY3iQIdo_21-8-rgb_front	7.62	Just make a loop and another loop and two little strings coming down.
-7BtY3iQIdo_22-8-rgb_front	3.0	And, then just a little dot there for the tie.
-7BtY3iQIdo_3-8-rgb_front	2.79	And, how you make pearls is you want to twist your bag.
-7BtY3iQIdo_4-8-rgb_front	1.33	Make it nice and tight.
-7BtY3iQIdo_5-8-rgb_front	1.54	And, you'll make little dots.
-7BtY3iQIdo_6-8-rgb_front	11.67	So, you just hold the tip over the paper or the cake about an eighth of an inch and you squeeze out until you get a little pearl.
-7BtY3iQIdo_7-8-rgb_front	3.83	And, as soon as it gets about this big then you pull it up.
-7BtY3iQIdo_8-8-rgb_front	4.71	Now, you don't want to squeeze squeeze squeeze and pull up and squeeze.
-7BtY3iQIdo_9-8-rgb_front	3.0	Because, you'll end up with something that looks like that.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_1-8-rgb_front	11.08	So we've completed our little pin cushion doll and I think she's so cute she's just a personal little hand made that would make a fun gift for any seamstress that you know.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_2-8-rgb_front	3.96	This would also be a great little project for a beginning sewer.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_3-8-rgb_front	5.33	It's very easy just stitching all the way around it and the pattern is very easy and stuffing in.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_4-8-rgb_front	10.96	This would be a good project maybe to work with like a child you can even use instead of stuffing you can use rice or even a bean bag.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_5-8-rgb_front	13.08	Or as I mentioned before this would also make a great little dog toy and with doll toys, you just always want to keep in mind that you don't want to use anything that can be pulled off or get stuck in your throat or anything.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_6-8-rgb_front	2.17	The same principle applies to children.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_7-8-rgb_front	9.88	If you are going to be making this doll for a baby then I would just stick with a felt and the embroidery because there is not really any little parts that can be pulled out or anything.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_8-8-rgb_front	4.54	But I think she's so fantastic and she's going to look so great as my pin cushion.
-7H7ZHO_4Ao_9-8-rgb_front	5.83	She's going to look fantastic on my desk so I hope you had as much fun making her as I did.
-7ZqO3skAxk_0-8-rgb_front	8.54	Now the first rule, the first thing you want to make sure you don't do when giving criticism is don't act in haste.
-7ZqO3skAxk_1-8-rgb_front	6.46	And what I mean by that is think about what you say before you say it.
-7ZqO3skAxk_2-8-rgb_front	9.17	There's an old saying that I think is real important to remember when we're talking about criticism, whether it?s written or whether it?s spoken.
-7ZqO3skAxk_3-8-rgb_front	1.42	"""You can never take it back."""
-7ZqO3skAxk_4-8-rgb_front	2.79	So once the words are out there they are out there.
-7ZqO3skAxk_5-8-rgb_front	3.62	So think about what you're going to say before you say it.
-7ZqO3skAxk_6-8-rgb_front	14.04	If someone is attacking you or something is coming at you, it?s harder to not jump on that and act very quickly and tell somebody how terrible they are or what a jerk they are or whatever it is.
-7ZqO3skAxk_7-8-rgb_front	12.12	But try to stop, think about it so that the words that you say are not hurtful and more critical and negative and don't exacerbate the whole situation.
-88OcTs9MPs_0-8-rgb_front	5.62	Hi this is Nigel with Blue Griffin Handyman and today we are going to talk about how to get rid of the paint smell in your house.
-88OcTs9MPs_1-8-rgb_front	5.25	The first thing to do, the best thing to do is to avoid the fumes altogether.
-88OcTs9MPs_2-8-rgb_front	12.67	Many paints these days come with a low VOC or a no VOC mixture and it will tell you on the back of the can like this one here says VOC at 132 grams per liter.
-88OcTs9MPs_3-8-rgb_front	25.12	Now VOC stands for volatile organic compounds and that is what is causing the fumes in your house so what you want to do if you have to use some of these paints with VOC in them the best thing to do is to open the windows, all the windows in the house and put a fan on one end of the house so you can draw all the fumes out of the house and try to go to the park for the day or something and get out of the house so you don't have the smell those nasty vapors.
-88OcTs9MPs_4-8-rgb_front	8.79	When you are using those type of paints with VOC in them definitely use some kind of breathing protection that will filter out those kinds of fumes.
-88OcTs9MPs_5-8-rgb_front	1.25	They are not good for you.
-88OcTs9MPs_6-8-rgb_front	3.5	So that is how to get the paint smell out of your house.
-8AYi1n0UWo_0-8-rgb_front	4.12	Hi, I'm James from Reptile Rescue Service in Salt Lake City, Utah.
-8AYi1n0UWo_1-8-rgb_front	5.08	If your turtle won't eat, that's the topic of this one, this discussion here.
-8AYi1n0UWo_10-8-rgb_front	3.38	So if you have one that has this disease, you need to keep 'em separate.
-8AYi1n0UWo_11-8-rgb_front	4.08	This will affect 'em on eating, and also they will be lazy and want to sleep a lot.
-8AYi1n0UWo_2-8-rgb_front	2.17	There could be a couple of variances of this one.
-8AYi1n0UWo_3-8-rgb_front	6.33	Could be, if it's a wild caught turtle, land turtle or tortoise, a lot of time they sense in they sense in the wintertime, it's time to hibernate.
-8AYi1n0UWo_4-8-rgb_front	5.38	At this time they'll quit eating, because if they have food in their belly when they go into hibernation, it can be fatal.
-8AYi1n0UWo_5-8-rgb_front	4.29	It'll actually ferment or rot, and can cause fatality to the turtle or tortoise.
-8AYi1n0UWo_6-8-rgb_front	6.38	Another sign of this could be if they have an upper respiratory infection, which is like a form of pneumonia to us humans.
-8AYi1n0UWo_7-8-rgb_front	1.79	It makes them weak and sick.
-8AYi1n0UWo_8-8-rgb_front	4.29	If it's a Russian tortoise, a lot of these carry herpes disease.
-8AYi1n0UWo_9-8-rgb_front	4.04	This is not contagious to humans, but it is to other tortoises.
-8EJ9aomFAc_4-8-rgb_front	7.67	The kids can add glitter to it, stickers, it's really easy to do and it's great if they are having a tea party with their friends.
-8EJ9aomFAc_5-8-rgb_front	2.25	You can get rid of all of that old wrapping paper.
-8EJ9aomFAc_6-8-rgb_front	5.42	And again, it's a great recyclable craft if you have birthday party paper from a child's birthday.
-8EJ9aomFAc_7-8-rgb_front	5.33	Pool it all together, make a bunch of hats and let the kids run around and really have a good time with them.
-8EJ9aomFAc_8-8-rgb_front	4.96	And I will go ahead and just place my hat on and say thank you.
-8L6L9fFWK8_0-8-rgb_front	0.25	Hi.
-8L6L9fFWK8_1-8-rgb_front	2.71	In this segment we're going to talk about consecutive rolls.
-8L6L9fFWK8_2-8-rgb_front	8.38	And what that means is doing a roll, and a roll, and a roll, and a roll, without stopping, without breaking any of the, any of the motion.
-8L6L9fFWK8_3-8-rgb_front	9.58	And the trick of that is, is right when the Frisbee comes to your second hand, is to push it up, right in the right angle, so it comes back to your other hand.
-8L6L9fFWK8_4-8-rgb_front	3.54	And it's again, it's the using your legs and using your arms.
-8L6L9fFWK8_5-8-rgb_front	5.46	But the last part is the critical part, to have it come here, so it sets up for your next roll.
-8L6L9fFWK8_6-8-rgb_front	13.88	An example of consecutive rolls: here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
-8L6L9fFWK8_7-8-rgb_front	7.33	Now if you noticed, every time that it came around to this arm, I was pushing it up, so it was almost right in the right spot for my next roll.
-8L6L9fFWK8_8-8-rgb_front	1.29	I didn't have to run around.
-8L6L9fFWK8_9-8-rgb_front	6.25	So the whole key is, is that right at the end and that push to make sure that it's set for the next roll.
-8XxBfXAzyo_1-8-rgb_front	5.92	Now, chameleons--one of the characteristics of chameleons is their amazing ability to change color.
-8XxBfXAzyo_10-8-rgb_front	8.04	So, as far as color changing goes, she also--many chameleons go through a breeding stage.
-8XxBfXAzyo_11-8-rgb_front	4.25	In the Veiled Chameleons, in males, it's called the sunburst phase.
-8XxBfXAzyo_12-8-rgb_front	5.75	They turn to bright colors, multi-colors, usually very bright, very eye-catching.
-8XxBfXAzyo_13-8-rgb_front	15.25	The females turn a--sometimes an orangish or brownish color during breeding season but many females will not display a very obvious change of color during breeding at all.
-8XxBfXAzyo_14-8-rgb_front	4.58	A hungry chameleon will often have--will often be trying to blend in with its environment.
-8XxBfXAzyo_15-8-rgb_front	7.17	This is when they tend to do that not only for hiding but for making sure that their prey doesn't see him.
-8XxBfXAzyo_16-8-rgb_front	8.88	Now, it's not just for hiding from enemies, they want to make sure that their prey is not aware of their presence either.
-8XxBfXAzyo_17-8-rgb_front	4.42	Now, an angry chameleon such as her--she's displaying right now.
-8XxBfXAzyo_18-8-rgb_front	1.42	What she's displaying is the angry colors.
-8XxBfXAzyo_19-8-rgb_front	1.5	She's trying to make sure that I know that I'm not welcome in her cage.
-8XxBfXAzyo_2-8-rgb_front	6.54	It's often thought that chameleons blend in with their environment but this is not the only reason they change color.
-8XxBfXAzyo_3-8-rgb_front	14.12	They do change colors with their environment to blend in such as browns for climbing on the trees, the greens for matching the leaves and they also turn colors when--according to their mood.
-8XxBfXAzyo_4-8-rgb_front	9.29	When they're angry, they tend to get--the Veiled Chameleons tend to get the black stripes with the white spots and the green in between.
-8XxBfXAzyo_5-8-rgb_front	6.12	And the sleeping chameleon will turn a bright lime green color with no spots.
-8XxBfXAzyo_6-8-rgb_front	7.0	Now, if she's cold, she's gonna--her whole body is going to turn more of a black color.
-8XxBfXAzyo_7-8-rgb_front	11.29	This is--because the dark colors absorb more heat and if she's cool, she's going to go sit under her basking light, turn a darker color and absorb as much heat as she can.
-8XxBfXAzyo_8-8-rgb_front	11.08	Now, when she is warm, when she's too warm, she's going to turn a lighter green color, sometimes a white color because this is when she wants to expel as much heat as she can.
-8XxBfXAzyo_9-8-rgb_front	12.62	This doesn't happen very often because of the fact that she likes the higher temperatures and where we live, we don't get too many high temperatures indoors.
-8j9K3T5lkw_0-8-rgb_front	1.38	DR. CHRIS MANGO: Hi.
-8j9K3T5lkw_1-8-rgb_front	2.25	This is Dr. Chris Mango, here in New York City.
-8j9K3T5lkw_3-8-rgb_front	2.5	The next muscle we're going to be taking a look at is the latissimus dorsi.
-8j9K3T5lkw_4-8-rgb_front	5.29	This is another common muscle that you might not know the name for, but everybody knows that they work under lats when they go to the gym.
-8j9K3T5lkw_5-8-rgb_front	4.5	Now, this can also cause a lot of pain in the side here, but it can also go into the arm a little bit.
-8j9K3T5lkw_6-8-rgb_front	0.75	Let's take a look.
-8j9K3T5lkw_7-8-rgb_front	9.38	Okay, so the latissimus dorsi connects along the iliac crest, up along the thoracic spine here, and then up into the shoulder and down.
-8j9K3T5lkw_8-8-rgb_front	9.38	Now, the muscles through this area, you can find trigger points through here and here, and that can cause pain that can come all in the side of the spine and down into the arm.
-8smPvP08mU_10-8-rgb_front	4.42	And you may not realize it, it may look okay, but there'll be something that's just off.
-8smPvP08mU_11-8-rgb_front	6.62	When you master getting the exact curves right, which is pretty easy, above the waist curve it down, below the waist, curve it up.
-8smPvP08mU_12-8-rgb_front	1.5	Everything falls into place after that.
-8smPvP08mU_9-8-rgb_front	7.62	But, same thing with hems and everything, your outfit will be completely wrong if you have the curve going the wrong way.
-8tIt1vEinQ_0-8-rgb_front	6.58	Right now I'm going to show you that, colors, I want to say cripple some people.
-8tIt1vEinQ_1-8-rgb_front	5.54	They get a mind set that they have to use the same colors over and over and over and over again.
-8tIt1vEinQ_10-8-rgb_front	0.38	Okay.
-8tIt1vEinQ_11-8-rgb_front	1.67	What colors do you think going to look good with it?
-8tIt1vEinQ_12-8-rgb_front	7.0	I don't know, let's try some yellow.
-8tIt1vEinQ_13-8-rgb_front	3.42	Just butt it up right next to it.
-8tIt1vEinQ_14-8-rgb_front	0.75	Yeah sure they look good together.
-8tIt1vEinQ_15-8-rgb_front	3.71	You know brown and green and blue are going to look good together because they're earth tones.
-8tIt1vEinQ_16-8-rgb_front	0.79	What about pink?
-8tIt1vEinQ_17-8-rgb_front	1.04	Does pink look good with brown?
-8tIt1vEinQ_18-8-rgb_front	5.25	Yes it does.
-8tIt1vEinQ_19-8-rgb_front	1.25	It looks very good with brown.
-8tIt1vEinQ_2-8-rgb_front	9.38	What you should do is when you're practicing, if you've got multiple colors like I do here, I have a tee shirt rack that's got 28, 29 colors on it.
-8tIt1vEinQ_20-8-rgb_front	3.62	You just got to remember that, don't be afraid to put colors together.
-8tIt1vEinQ_21-8-rgb_front	8.92	One thing my father taught me was, if you've got colors that are opposite of the color wheel, and that means if it's a cold color or a hot color meaning red or blue.
-8tIt1vEinQ_22-8-rgb_front	6.38	If you put them together they're going to vibrate against each other and they're going to get your attention and that's the whole point of putting them together is to get your attention.
-8tIt1vEinQ_23-8-rgb_front	1.71	So don't be afraid to put colors together.
-8tIt1vEinQ_24-8-rgb_front	4.5	Pink and brown, do something cool with the brown letters with a pink background and it'll look nice.
-8tIt1vEinQ_25-8-rgb_front	0.42	Thank you.
-8tIt1vEinQ_3-8-rgb_front	1.88	And you'll see that I have multiple air brushes.
-8tIt1vEinQ_4-8-rgb_front	2.42	At one time I had an air brush on every color.
-8tIt1vEinQ_5-8-rgb_front	4.29	And it just increases speed and efficiency whenever you're painting something.
-8tIt1vEinQ_6-8-rgb_front	2.25	Just take a color, say I've got brown.
-8tIt1vEinQ_7-8-rgb_front	3.5	Just find out what colors look good together with it.
-8tIt1vEinQ_8-8-rgb_front	8.42	I just draw a line of it.
-8tIt1vEinQ_9-8-rgb_front	0.79	Right in the middle.
-8uwu59w8QE_0-8-rgb_front	0.17	Hi!
-8uwu59w8QE_10-8-rgb_front	14.67	I recommend strongly that original core that we talked about a long time ago have one person who is going to be the coordinator for vending, ideally you will have a vendor coordinator and someone also to handle food who may be with food booth or may understand industry.
-8uwu59w8QE_11-8-rgb_front	5.08	It is a very specialized area and you can get yourself into all certain types of hassles if you don't do it right.
-8uwu59w8QE_12-8-rgb_front	1.88	I suggest you getting a vending coordinator.
-8uwu59w8QE_13-8-rgb_front	6.71	One for food and one for non-food vending and work with the vendors the best that they can.
-8uwu59w8QE_14-8-rgb_front	4.5	In the next segment we are going to talk about another money issue which is sponsorship.
-8uwu59w8QE_15-8-rgb_front	0.5	Stay with me.
-8uwu59w8QE_2-8-rgb_front	3.0	In this segment, I am going to touch on vending.
-8uwu59w8QE_3-8-rgb_front	2.54	How to work with vendors and what they are all about.
-8uwu59w8QE_4-8-rgb_front	1.92	When you go to a festival, you will also often see vendors.
-8uwu59w8QE_5-8-rgb_front	4.04	You will see food vendors, non-food vendors, craft and arts and so on.
-8uwu59w8QE_6-8-rgb_front	3.5	As a producer of the event, you need to look at it also as one of your income producers.
-8uwu59w8QE_7-8-rgb_front	8.46	If you realize that each of those vendors might be paying say a $100 and if you have ten of those vendors that is a $1,000 that your festival has already to work with.
-8uwu59w8QE_8-8-rgb_front	9.25	How many you have will also depend upon your budget and your site and what you can fit in but you need to think in terms of food and non-food vendors being an intricate part of your event.
-8uwu59w8QE_9-8-rgb_front	10.5	Food vendors are a whole scene onto themselves because of the complications, health requirements, heating requirements and cooling requirements and the need for power that they bring into your festival.
-916rCqIrfY_0-5-rgb_front	4.25	Admittedly, my kicks aren't the most fancy or flashy in the world.
-916rCqIrfY_1-5-rgb_front	2.96	I don't kick people in the head standing up.
-916rCqIrfY_10-5-rgb_front	10.96	(demo) I could have an attacker dealing with me over on this side, and I may have to kick him to stop him from grabbing while I deal with this other attacker.
-916rCqIrfY_11-5-rgb_front	8.29	What I might want to do, instead of kicking the body like I said, here, (demo) is come in and kick the leg out.
-916rCqIrfY_12-5-rgb_front	4.46	You can have a lot of good effects kicking someone's knee out just like this.
-916rCqIrfY_13-5-rgb_front	5.54	(demo) If you're to the side of the person, (demo) kick out the inside of the leg.
-916rCqIrfY_14-5-rgb_front	7.75	Or, you can kick out the outside of the leg (demo) just like this.
-916rCqIrfY_15-5-rgb_front	3.38	Now, I'm doing that really easy because you can damage the person's knee.
-916rCqIrfY_16_17_18-5-rgb_front	12.71	But you'll see the way the leg folds (demo) just by kicking on the outside. Switch your feet. Or, the inside (demo) just like that.
-916rCqIrfY_19-5-rgb_front	7.42	Again, be very careful of practicing these kicks because you can roll the knee out and twist the ankle and the knee at the same time.
-916rCqIrfY_2-5-rgb_front	5.96	If I'm going to kick him in the head, I'm going to knock him down to the ground first, and then I'll kick him in the head where I don't have to stretch that far.
-916rCqIrfY_20-5-rgb_front	6.54	But, I think it's a great way to kick, bring it up, out, (demo) just like this.
-916rCqIrfY_3-5-rgb_front	2.42	A side kick is a good technique.
-916rCqIrfY_4-5-rgb_front	14.92	A side kick, basically the way I do it, is I stand sideways to my partner, I'm going to take a step in, cross, kick up and out.
-916rCqIrfY_5-5-rgb_front	6.5	When I kick, I'm kicking with the outside edge of my foot, here, (demo) and then back.
-916rCqIrfY_6-5-rgb_front	2.0	One, two.
-916rCqIrfY_7-5-rgb_front	5.25	(demo) One, two, three, four.
-916rCqIrfY_8-5-rgb_front	4.25	(demo) My target, of course, will be anywhere on the body.
-916rCqIrfY_9-5-rgb_front	6.46	I prefer to kick in the legs, but for this example, I'm going to kick in the body (demo) just like this.
-96cWDhR4hc_0-5-rgb_front	30.0	I'm using a heavy duty stapler and you want to make sure you test out your stapler on a scrap piece of wood to make sure that you know where the placement of the stapler is going to be because we're on a very narrow strip here and we don't want to miss our mark when we put our stapler in.
-96cWDhR4hc_1-5-rgb_front	22.75	Now with these heavy duty staplers, you want to place it and put your hand right here to give downward pressure right here because if you don't the stapler tends to want to jump up and the staple won't go in properly.
-96cWDhR4hc_10-5-rgb_front	3.12	Just color up those staples, it makes a big difference.
-96cWDhR4hc_11-5-rgb_front	2.54	You don't notice them as much.
-96cWDhR4hc_2-5-rgb_front	13.17	So, some of them have a little spot on top and they call it a power button and that's what they want you to do is push down and staple.
-96cWDhR4hc_3-5-rgb_front	5.62	And then you have got a good staple right there nice and secure.
-96cWDhR4hc_4-5-rgb_front	10.12	We're going to staple all the way down the edge and put those staples fairly close.
-96cWDhR4hc_5-5-rgb_front	10.12	Now, when you're going over the whole section, you're going to need something to rest the stapler on.
-96cWDhR4hc_6-5-rgb_front	5.38	Here i have just put a roll of tape, something that I can lean on.
-96cWDhR4hc_7-5-rgb_front	9.67	If you don't use that, your stapler is going to go into the hole and it will shoot in the wrong direction.
-96cWDhR4hc_8-5-rgb_front	25.46	So, you want to have something to prop up that stapler and we'll go about every half inch all the way down the side trying to keep those staples in a nice even row.
-96cWDhR4hc_9-5-rgb_front	17.62	As a finishing touch, you might want to take a permanent marker and color over the staples so they don't stand out as much or you can touch it up with a little paint also.
-98tdkCF-sY_5-5-rgb_front	21.29	And most of those dealers are setup with secondary finance companies that deal strictly with people that have bad credit or non-existent credit as opposed to the bigger dealerships, the big chains, the big Ford dealerships or the big Chevrolet dealerships.
-98tdkCF-sY_6-5-rgb_front	10.25	Go to a smaller, buy here, pay here and most of those will have secondary financing.
-98tdkCF-sY_7-5-rgb_front	5.38	That's exactly how you get a car loan with bad credit or non-existing credit.
-98tdkCF-sY_8-5-rgb_front	4.79	Again, my name is Adriel Torres and I'm the owner of ultimatecredittoday.com.
-98tdkCF-sY_9-5-rgb_front	1.21	Thank you very much.
-9D6kP1TgbY_0-8-rgb_front	1.79	Okay, the eyes are basically done.
-9D6kP1TgbY_1-8-rgb_front	2.21	This is our perfect eye look for Goth.
-9D6kP1TgbY_10-8-rgb_front	10.96	We don't want the eye brows to look too over done or too powdered, so I'm just going to fill in a little bit just to get a nice natural arch.
-9D6kP1TgbY_11-8-rgb_front	4.33	The eyebrows really shape the face, especially when you have such a dramatic eye shadow look.
-9D6kP1TgbY_12-8-rgb_front	3.17	You really want to make sure that you don't forget your eyebrows.
-9D6kP1TgbY_13-8-rgb_front	11.25	Because her eyebrows are a little short, I'm going to draw just a tiny bit onto the ends just to extend them a little bit.
-9D6kP1TgbY_14-8-rgb_front	1.83	Add a little more if you want to.
-9D6kP1TgbY_15-8-rgb_front	1.21	It's all personal preference.
-9D6kP1TgbY_16-8-rgb_front	1.75	Again, how dark you want your brows to be.
-9D6kP1TgbY_17-8-rgb_front	3.88	Try to use a color that most closely matches your natural hair color.
-9D6kP1TgbY_18-8-rgb_front	6.46	Once you get your desired shape, take a little brow comb or brow brush and brush through the brows.
-9D6kP1TgbY_19-8-rgb_front	0.92	Even everything out.
-9D6kP1TgbY_2-8-rgb_front	3.08	We're going to do a little bit in the brows.
-9D6kP1TgbY_20-8-rgb_front	0.96	Blend everything.
-9D6kP1TgbY_21-8-rgb_front	9.5	What this does is it takes away the excess powder, blends everything in, and also you shape your brow at that point to your desired shape.
-9D6kP1TgbY_22-8-rgb_front	1.88	Look how perfect that brow looks.
-9D6kP1TgbY_3-8-rgb_front	1.75	Her brows are pretty light.
-9D6kP1TgbY_4-8-rgb_front	2.38	They're nicely shaped, but they're pretty light.
-9D6kP1TgbY_5-8-rgb_front	3.04	We want them to match more of her dark chestnut hair color.
-9D6kP1TgbY_6-8-rgb_front	1.79	I'm using a powder and a brush.
-9D6kP1TgbY_7-8-rgb_front	0.79	You can use a pencil.
-9D6kP1TgbY_8-8-rgb_front	1.46	It's all personal preference.
-9D6kP1TgbY_9-8-rgb_front	2.67	I'm just going to fill in her natural brow line.
-9GV_-VRpt8_0-8-rgb_front	7.25	Hi, this is Sean Hobson and what we're talking about right now is using the proper mechanics to become not only a good shooter, but a good shooter from the free throw line.
-9GV_-VRpt8_1-8-rgb_front	3.25	So the last step that we have is to finish out your free throw.
-9GV_-VRpt8_10-8-rgb_front	10.46	What we see a lot of players do is they'll follow through, but then they'll pull their hand back and again, that's going to pull that basketball back a little bit and not let it go ahead and follow through the proper way.
-9GV_-VRpt8_11-8-rgb_front	6.25	The last thing is we don't want to fall take our shot and fall back off the free throw line.
-9GV_-VRpt8_12-8-rgb_front	3.79	If you shoot and you take a step back, it?s called negative energy.
-9GV_-VRpt8_13-8-rgb_front	4.54	You're taking energy away from that basketball and not allowing it to go on down.
-9GV_-VRpt8_14-8-rgb_front	8.04	So, remember when making a good free throw shot, its not just the shot, its also how you finish after the free throw that's going to make you a good free throw shooter.
-9GV_-VRpt8_2-8-rgb_front	2.79	If Kyle steps up to the line right here and gets himself ready.
-9GV_-VRpt8_3-8-rgb_front	4.75	What we're going to talk about is you have a good base, you have a good foundation.
-9GV_-VRpt8_4-8-rgb_front	3.62	You're going to make the shot
-9GV_-VRpt8_5-8-rgb_front	1.58	That's the first thing in finishing.
-9GV_-VRpt8_6-8-rgb_front	10.67	But the most important thing is by using your legs, a lot of time you see players come up and shoot their free throw and they stay flat footed and then end up hitting the ball on the front of the rim.
-9GV_-VRpt8_7-8-rgb_front	13.38	What we always want to do is you always want to finish your free throw up on your toes because what that does is when you get up on your toes, that's using the bottom of your leg muscles and its giving you just that extra edge to get that ball up and over the rim.
-9GV_-VRpt8_8-8-rgb_front	5.42	The other thing you want to make sure and do is always follow through and end up out in front of you.
-9GV_-VRpt8_9-8-rgb_front	2.33	You never want to end up with the ball up here.
-9Kic0QsCYs_0-8-rgb_front	0.29	ALLEN DIWAN: Hi.
-9Kic0QsCYs_1-8-rgb_front	0.67	My name is Allen Diwan.
-9Kic0QsCYs_10-8-rgb_front	8.25	And it's also, cooking the food is also about seeing the color of the food in the dish.
-9Kic0QsCYs_11-8-rgb_front	1.5	You'll see the different flavors.
-9Kic0QsCYs_12-8-rgb_front	15.62	You'll see the different ingredients that we are going to put in this dish that you see the unique--the ingre--the colors of each and every ingredient, and this is part of the appeal.
-9Kic0QsCYs_13-8-rgb_front	16.04	I might add one more tomato of this dish, that you can see it's very rustic and you have to make it appetizing for--'cause you eat with your eyes as well, and you want to make this dish as appetizing as possible.
-9Kic0QsCYs_14-8-rgb_front	16.08	So, this is quite a straight forward recipe, and the ginger, garlic, we're waiting for the ginger to cook properly.
-9Kic0QsCYs_15-8-rgb_front	9.67	And for 1 more 2--1 or 2 more minutes, we'll give it--we'll leave it for 1 or 2 more minutes, and then we'll add our tomatoes to this.
-9Kic0QsCYs_2-8-rgb_front	2.5	I'm the owner and chef of Kashmir Indian Restaurant in Budapest.
-9Kic0QsCYs_4-8-rgb_front	3.0	The dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.
-9Kic0QsCYs_5-8-rgb_front	8.88	One ingredient that we'll be adding also is the tomatoes whilst the ginger and the garlic have been cooked slightly.
-9Kic0QsCYs_6-8-rgb_front	6.88	So, just--we'll give it one more shake, stir it once more properly.
-9Kic0QsCYs_7-8-rgb_front	5.21	The onions have been slightly browned now, and we added our green ginger, garlic, and the chilies.
-9Kic0QsCYs_8-8-rgb_front	12.54	We'll wait for that to cook and in the meanwhile, we'll take our tomatoes, maybe about 3 of them, and we'll cut them into cubes.
-9Kic0QsCYs_9-8-rgb_front	16.46	Again, we do not want tomatoes to be cut into very small cubes because we want to see, I mean, obviously, it will be cooked well with the masala, but you'll somehow see the redness of the tomato.
-9KqRMBAAsA_1_2-3-rgb_front	10.5	As I mentioned earlier most portable electric sanders run on 110 or house current. Pretty much any extension cord will work.
-9KqRMBAAsA_3-3-rgb_front	3.67	These sanders don't require significant amounts of power.
-9KqRMBAAsA_4-3-rgb_front	7.88	You don't need a very heavy gauge extension cord, your standard, I think this is a fourteen gauge extension cord, will do.
-9KqRMBAAsA_5-3-rgb_front	6.62	But to power it up, first, make sure your sander is in the off position, make sure the power switch is off.
-9KqRMBAAsA_6-3-rgb_front	12.46	And then a little helpful thing that I like to do is before I connect my extension cord, to help keep it from coming unplugged while you're using it, we're going to tie a knot in the cord.
-9KqRMBAAsA_7-3-rgb_front	10.04	We'll just hold the two, come around, draw it into a knot and now you can plug it in.
-9KqRMBAAsA_8-3-rgb_front	6.62	Notice that one pole on the extension cord is larger than the other so it will only go in one way.
-9KqRMBAAsA_9-3-rgb_front	2.42	Plug it in and you're ready to go.
-9TmNCFEtDo_1-8-rgb_front	6.75	Lesson 12-The Mascara Brush: Every mascara bottle of course comes with a mascara brush.
-9TmNCFEtDo_2-8-rgb_front	3.5	They all do come in different shapes and different sizes.
-9TmNCFEtDo_3-8-rgb_front	15.21	I like this mascara and the best way to apply your mascara and use your mascara brush is to start from the inner most part of your eyelash and wiggle and work your way up to the tip of your eyelash.
-9TmNCFEtDo_4-8-rgb_front	7.0	This adds fullness to the eyelash without actually not having to use a volumizer mascara.
-9TmNCFEtDo_5-8-rgb_front	12.62	Mascara brushes are sold at drug stores or your beauty supply store and they do come in different sizes, like I said, and it is best to change your mascara brush because it tends to build up bacteria and to clump.
-9TmNCFEtDo_6-8-rgb_front	11.46	The best way to prevent clumping is to actually take your mascara brush, and if you do see any clumps on your brush, is to wipe it off on a napkin or a paper towel that won't leave any residue behind.
-9TmNCFEtDo_7-8-rgb_front	13.29	It's best not to take your mascara brush and wipe the excess off on the lid of the bottle because that just rubs right back in and that's what causes the clumping, and then you'll have the clumps left over on your eyelashes.
-9TmNCFEtDo_8-8-rgb_front	2.38	That is the mascara brush and that's how you use it.
-9__F8XKDuE_0-8-rgb_front	3.75	I would like to talk with you now about international stoves.
-9__F8XKDuE_1-8-rgb_front	8.96	When you see the word international you would think about going overseas and you may be going into a country where certain fuels are hard to find.
-9__F8XKDuE_2-8-rgb_front	7.46	This liquid fuel stove happens to be a white gas stove but they make a version of it that uses multiple fuels.
-9__F8XKDuE_3-8-rgb_front	10.83	Kerosene, some of them will even burn diesel, naphta, different fuels that might be easier for you to find elsewhere.
-9__F8XKDuE_4-8-rgb_front	13.12	This stove right here has a special feature, if you don't find an MSR cartridge abroad you might find some other ones and they might not have a thread to screw on.
-9__F8XKDuE_5-8-rgb_front	9.71	So what this has it has a little catch that goes over top of here and then instead of screwing on it descends down on to the cartridge.
-9__F8XKDuE_6-8-rgb_front	5.46	These type of stoves give you a little more latitude of what kind of fuel you can get for them.
-9__F8XKDuE_7-8-rgb_front	3.46	If you have any questions on these types of stoves give your outfitter a holler.
-9_jI7kWiQY_0-8-rgb_front	4.33	So the next step in making your clays is going to be to sieve the mixture.
-9_jI7kWiQY_1-8-rgb_front	21.46	Now I've got one of these large fancy sieves, it's got brushes on the bottom and it turns, and then it comes with screens at different meshes, this one is 80 mesh
-9_jI7kWiQY_2-8-rgb_front	12.88	Anywhere from about 80 to 100 is appropriate for most glazes, a 50 might not be fine enough, and you don't want to go too much thinner than a 100, because some of your materials might not be small enough to go through.
-9_jI7kWiQY_3-8-rgb_front	6.04	So you're going to mix, just stir up again, feel the bottom, you want to have a large spoon.
-9_jI7kWiQY_4-8-rgb_front	4.33	Make sure that there's no big chunks kind of laying in weight down there.
-9_jI7kWiQY_5-8-rgb_front	6.21	And then you'll take a pitcher, and get a scoop, poor it right into your sieve.
-9_jI7kWiQY_6-8-rgb_front	5.08	And then with this one you just turn the brushes, and that pushes the material through the screen.
-9_jI7kWiQY_7-8-rgb_front	10.79	If you don't have a big fancy one like this with the brushes, a lot of times wear a rubber clove and just kind of use your hand to work the materials through the screen that works also.
-9_jI7kWiQY_8-8-rgb_front	5.46	So I'm going to go through this entire bucket, and just keep scooping and pushing it through the screen, until I've got the whole thing complete.
-9byTo0hUbM_9-8-rgb_front	3.38	That's how you do it, I'm Russ Handler, and I need to make a phone call.
-9nBmSvp2Co_0-8-rgb_front	5.62	Okay, it is efficiently chilled, just brought it out of the refrigerator.
-9nBmSvp2Co_1-8-rgb_front	2.96	It was in there about twenty five minutes or so.
-9nBmSvp2Co_10-8-rgb_front	2.17	Tastes dearly, ooh, okay.
-9nBmSvp2Co_11-8-rgb_front	4.33	So that's what you look for, just nice solid fudge.
-9nBmSvp2Co_12-8-rgb_front	1.79	Again, put it in the freezer if you need to.
-9nBmSvp2Co_13-8-rgb_front	4.5	I will say that if you want to take this with you somewhere, try to keep it in a frig.
-9nBmSvp2Co_14-8-rgb_front	4.79	You know if you take it to the office maybe as a little dessert after your lunch, that's a great idea.
-9nBmSvp2Co_15-8-rgb_front	1.71	Just pop it back in the frig when you get to work.
-9nBmSvp2Co_16-8-rgb_front	3.88	Because again that coconut oil is very sensitive to temperature.
-9nBmSvp2Co_17-8-rgb_front	9.21	So, it's perfectly congealed for me and solidified but as soon as I'm done you know, cutting it and showing you what it looks like I'm going to put it back in the freezer.
-9nBmSvp2Co_18-8-rgb_front	1.08	So just keep that in mind.
-9nBmSvp2Co_2-8-rgb_front	2.29	And you can pop it in the freezer if you need to, that's okay too.
-9nBmSvp2Co_3-8-rgb_front	2.25	You'll see that it's not even.
-9nBmSvp2Co_4-8-rgb_front	7.46	We poured it in and it was smooth, and now it looks like a rough rugged terrain that you would need a four wheel drive to go over.
-9nBmSvp2Co_5-8-rgb_front	1.0	But that's okay.
-9nBmSvp2Co_6-8-rgb_front	3.96	Fudge is homemade, at least it should be, so that's okay, not a big deal.
-9nBmSvp2Co_7-8-rgb_front	2.71	I personally don't care what my fudge looks like as long as it tastes good.
-9nBmSvp2Co_8-8-rgb_front	7.33	It even has a little ridge right here that cracked, you know, not, didn't crack but it has a little ridge that broke off.
-9nBmSvp2Co_9-8-rgb_front	0.46	That's okay.
-9umTJVGSqk_4-8-rgb_front	5.58	What will happen is the contact lens will stick to a wet surface better than a dry surface.
-9umTJVGSqk_5-8-rgb_front	0.54	Take it in.
-9umTJVGSqk_6-8-rgb_front	6.08	Put it on the fingertip, move it over, and pinch it off.
-9zB8cv_WJk_10-8-rgb_front	7.38	You can sand that glue smooth until you feel comfortable putting your other piece on, to make a smooth transition between the two pieces.
-9zB8cv_WJk_11-8-rgb_front	13.0	Once you get the glue off, you just simply, simply stick your other adhesive tile down in its place and you have a fixed adhesive tile.
-9zB8cv_WJk_12-8-rgb_front	20.25	Now there are other options if you're having trouble getting the adhesive tile off the floor, you can actually soak a rag in solvent and drape the rag over the top of the floor and cover it with plastic to keep the fumes from getting out and that will actually work on dissolving that glue underneath and may make it a little bit easier for you to get that piece out.
-9zB8cv_WJk_13-8-rgb_front	5.0	My name's Ryan Parker with Parker Home Renovations and you can contact me at: parkerhomerenovations.com.
-9zB8cv_WJk_4-8-rgb_front	2.33	So you may have to replace it with something close to it.
-9zB8cv_WJk_5-8-rgb_front	14.21	Now the first thing you're going to need to do when repairing one of these vinyl floor, flooring pieces is take your utility knife and you're actually going to want to cut off a corner of the tile.
-9zB8cv_WJk_6-8-rgb_front	13.83	So, you're going to want to do like that, and then if you can, in some cases you could actually get into the, that piece with the end of your razor blade and pick it out like this.
-9zB8cv_WJk_7-8-rgb_front	6.83	If you're lucky enough to be able to do that, then from there you can pretty much pick at it and tear that piece out.
-9zB8cv_WJk_8-8-rgb_front	13.83	If you can't get to it like that, you may have to get creative with a, like a chisel of some sort and just get a hammer and chisel it up, and then you can get a chisel from the other side and chisel that piece out.
-9zB8cv_WJk_9-8-rgb_front	20.0	Once you get that piece out, then you'll have to get whatever glue is on, on the floor, off, and how you can do that is you can use any kind of a cleaner to actually soak that area for a little while and you can scrape it up with a razor or you can sand that glue if that glue is really dry.
-c5CKp2JWHE_0-5-rgb_front	5.67	This Koshinage, or hip throw, is going to be from a hook strike, or Yokimunuchi.
-c5CKp2JWHE_1-5-rgb_front	2.38	Daniel's going to blast me to the side of the head.
-c5CKp2JWHE_10-5-rgb_front	6.17	Now he's already bleeding out, there's nowhere for that foot to go, I can draw him into my hips.
-c5CKp2JWHE_11-5-rgb_front	3.62	Here, I've trapped.
-c5CKp2JWHE_12-5-rgb_front	2.21	It's here, he's trapped.
-c5CKp2JWHE_13-5-rgb_front	2.17	Now we'll go ahead and get on the hip.
-c5CKp2JWHE_14-5-rgb_front	8.21	Here I am, locked up in the hip
-c5CKp2JWHE_15-5-rgb_front	1.71	Let's do that one more time.
-c5CKp2JWHE_16-5-rgb_front	4.12	Blending with it, hooking the hip.
-c5CKp2JWHE_17-5-rgb_front	4.33	That's Koshinage, the hip throw, from a hook strike, Yokimunuchi.
-c5CKp2JWHE_2-5-rgb_front	11.38	This is a very dynamic Kushinage, because I have to blend with the oncoming strike, and time myself so I can end up on his hip at the same time.
-c5CKp2JWHE_3-5-rgb_front	1.67	So you need to end up in here.
-c5CKp2JWHE_4-5-rgb_front	3.62	What I'm going to do is come in and dominate here.
-c5CKp2JWHE_5-5-rgb_front	5.62	He's already spinning in this motion, so all I need to do is plant my hip there and draw him over.
-c5CKp2JWHE_6-5-rgb_front	5.92	Here, here's my hip, I'm already in position, and away we go.
-c5CKp2JWHE_7-5-rgb_front	2.42	There's a couple tricky things about this.
-c5CKp2JWHE_8-5-rgb_front	6.58	Is when I do this, I don't want to step way out here, because I'm really out of center.
-c5CKp2JWHE_9-5-rgb_front	8.38	I only want to step, here, almost stepping on his foot, that allows me to get good position.
-dK6mH2v-64_0-5-rgb_front	12.25	So, as we drop into this dragon position, a lot of whether your foot is flat on the floor is going to depend on your ankle flexibility.
-dK6mH2v-64_1-5-rgb_front	8.42	Many people don't have the flexibility to be able to put their heel flat on the floor in this position.
-dK6mH2v-64_2-5-rgb_front	13.54	So, it's perfectly fine to keep that ankle bent up to whatever angle you need to in order to maintain this position.
-dK6mH2v-64_3-5-rgb_front	16.88	The ankle is not necessarily important, it's keeping the body sunk down over the leg, which is important, wherever your ankle manages to be in that position is fine.
-dK6mH2v-64_4-5-rgb_front	25.88	That being said, the more you can draw your heel down to the floor and sink forward, the more you're going to be gaining flexibility in the ankle and that's going to help your martial arts training, especially when we're doing kicks and using darthaflexion and Plantar flexion for thrusting forward
0-0kX3XoMPQ_0-3-rgb_front	6.21	Alright folks, in this series we are drawing magical objects and in this clip I'm going to teach you how to draw a magic lamp.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_1-3-rgb_front	5.92	I'm going to do that right down here.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_10-3-rgb_front	32.75	Come on down just like that and then obviously we will add some details to it just to make it look more interesting, just like that and then you know if you want to you can add a polished sort of shine to it if you want and texture it a bit just to make it look a bit more interesting but that is basically it.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_11-3-rgb_front	1.75	The genie's magic lamp.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_2-3-rgb_front	3.88	So obviously you know the story roughly behind the magic lamp.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_3-3-rgb_front	4.96	Everyone is sort of familiar with the little genie thing.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_4-3-rgb_front	9.71	What we are going to do is we are going to start by drawing the rough shape and I would say the rough shape of a lamp, a magic lamp is almost like the head of an elephant.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_5-3-rgb_front	9.12	It has got a little head and then what we'll do you might equate to a long snout, trunk.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_6-3-rgb_front	8.12	So we'll come in here and we'll draw the tip of the lamp first and that is obviously where the magic happens right there.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_7-3-rgb_front	11.96	Then we'll come up here and we'll draw the top, the little lid where they have, obviously pour in the oil and things like that.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_8-3-rgb_front	16.75	And then we come in here and we'll draw the handle something like this right there.
0-0kX3XoMPQ_9-3-rgb_front	8.12	Then the base which would be something like this that it has got to be able to stand on.
0-4j8fghNOE_1-5-rgb_front	7.22	So now were going to get fresh garlic here's our fresh garlic definitely go out and get some fresh garlic.
0-4j8fghNOE_2-5-rgb_front	9.26	There's no other way to make some fresh bruschetta than to use the whole fresh ingredients you have your garlic were going to use a lot of it.
0-4j8fghNOE_3-5-rgb_front	11.43	Just take your butchers knife and just give it a good from the point down slam it like so give it a good punch like that.
0-4j8fghNOE_4-5-rgb_front	14.89	You'll see it'll break apart real easy were going to use about 8 cloves sounds like a lot of garlic but it's a great dish I know listen about the good thing about garlic is very good for you.
0-4j8fghNOE_5-5-rgb_front	9.43	It's very good for you and if everybody eats garlic nobody has garlic breath so make sure everybody eats a little bit of this.
0-4j8fghNOE_6-5-rgb_front	9.8	When I get back were going to start chopping up the individual garlic putting it together make sure you get some fresh garlic for this.
0-4j8fghNOE_7-5-rgb_front	14.56	It's very important you want about 8 cloves this is a clove inside your garlic so you want about 8 of those when I come back we'll start chopping it up and I'll show you how to get it out of there as well.
0-CH0nKReGk_0-5-rgb_front	5.84	Let's talk about why acupuncture can help us control weight.
0-CH0nKReGk_1-5-rgb_front	8.88	The first mechanism, we already mentioned, balancing the nervous system to control the appetite.
0-CH0nKReGk_2-5-rgb_front	7.97	And the second one is acupuncture help induce the beta- endorphin.
0-CH0nKReGk_3-5-rgb_front	7.51	We mentioned that about beta-endorphin make us feel good and it relieve the pain.
0-CH0nKReGk_4-5-rgb_front	9.97	But another effect of beta-endorphin can have is control our appetite.
0-CH0nKReGk_5-5-rgb_front	13.81	For instance, when you run 10 miles, and you pass your second wind, then you feel so good, so energetic, then you don't want to eat for a while.
0-CH0nKReGk_6-5-rgb_front	8.55	But if you don't exercise, you sit in front of TV for the whole evening, then you just keep eating.
0-CH0nKReGk_7-5-rgb_front	3.59	It seems you never get satisfied with the food.
0-CH0nKReGk_8-5-rgb_front	7.51	And if you eat the wrong food, then it's very easy for you to gain 20 pounds within a year.
0-I67scsfIE_1-5-rgb_front	4.84	And in this segment, I'm just going to explain a little bit how we're going to wrap up our mural.
0-I67scsfIE_10-5-rgb_front	9.38	So as soon as I get my letters painted in, then I can or--I'm sorry--draw in with a pencil then I can paint it in.
0-I67scsfIE_2-5-rgb_front	8.3	We're doing a construction sign here and it's going to say--we're going to put another put coat on it so it's a solid orange like a real construction sign.
0-I67scsfIE_3-5-rgb_front	6.51	"And then we're going to put ""Caution: Boys at Work"" and we'll do that in black writing so it looks like one."
0-I67scsfIE_4-5-rgb_front	16.68	And then I've taped it off right here so when I paint in my post, for this to be in the foreground, then it looks like it's standing on a post in the foreground and then you've got the construction in the background.
0-I67scsfIE_5-5-rgb_front	8.88	After we're done with that, I'm just going to put in a little bit of shadows on the bottom.
0-I67scsfIE_6-5-rgb_front	5.05	You can use a stencil to put in your lettering if you ever do lettering.
0-I67scsfIE_7-5-rgb_front	3.96	I like to hand-paint my mine in.
0-I67scsfIE_8-5-rgb_front	12.26	I'll usually ruler it out and tape it in line so your words are really straight on there, but stencils work too.
0-I67scsfIE_9-5-rgb_front	10.22	And what I would do is I would do another coat on this, let it dry, and then I would pencil in my letters so I get it right with my paint.
0-QttpoWp_8_0-5-rgb_front	10.67	The next step once you have your wreath up here on a horizontal surface, excuse me, a vertical surface is you need to start going ahead and anchoring your flowers in.
0-QttpoWp_8_1-5-rgb_front	31.38	Again what I use is the wire and I make sure that everything that is holding horizontal is wrapped and I'll even wrap the wire up a stem of the flower to make sure that it is held on correctly, come down and wrap it around the main frame.
0-QttpoWp_8_2-5-rgb_front	20.88	This is something you need to make sure you do when you are outside in the weather because you don't want it to be blown away so you can create all these little tracks of wire and wrap it around the flowers to help hold it stable.
0-QttpoWp_8_3-5-rgb_front	20.5	The next thing you do after that is you can go ahead and start adding any other kind of flowers or fill into it with a hot glue gun and then you can tuck them into your little pockets of wire and base material that you started.
0-QttpoWp_8_4-5-rgb_front	13.33	So the next part is going ahead and anchoring all your flowers on a vertical place so that they will stay and you have to deal with the wind and elements of the weather.
0-_hOoXzsWw_0-5-rgb_front	5.54	So in this segment we're going to continue with the idea of testing rooting with a partner.
0-_hOoXzsWw_1-5-rgb_front	9.17	So as in the last one we already, the idea is that Ray is using his mind to redirect my force downward.
0-_hOoXzsWw_10-5-rgb_front	7.83	Again, it's not win, lose, it's the idea to increase the sensitivity of our rootedness.
0-_hOoXzsWw_11-5-rgb_front	6.42	So as I push, he roots, he roots, he roots, and I'm pushing pretty hard right now.
0-_hOoXzsWw_12-5-rgb_front	1.83	Now why do we do it this way?
0-_hOoXzsWw_13-5-rgb_front	2.12	It's the most vulnerable position.
0-_hOoXzsWw_14-5-rgb_front	7.17	So if he just stands up and doesn't try and root and I push him, it takes no effort to push him over.
0-_hOoXzsWw_15-5-rgb_front	6.96	That's why we do it here so you can really see that you really were rooting that energy.
0-_hOoXzsWw_2-5-rgb_front	7.38	But as I start pushing harder and harder, there is a mind set that you want to resist that.
0-_hOoXzsWw_3-5-rgb_front	6.54	So what, what a lot of times happens is the person leans into it to not let you push them.
0-_hOoXzsWw_4-5-rgb_front	1.71	They think that that's rooting.
0-_hOoXzsWw_5-5-rgb_front	3.46	But really it's not rooting because look at what happened.
0-_hOoXzsWw_6-5-rgb_front	12.75	Right, so also the other mistake is that you are pushing hard and not able to root so you start leaning back, leaning back, and then you could push that person over.
0-_hOoXzsWw_7-5-rgb_front	5.38	So it's very important that it's a good partner relationship.
0-_hOoXzsWw_8-5-rgb_front	10.54	So as I start pushing, if I start pushing too hard, he's not able to root and he feels himself resisting, he tells me, back off a little bit.
0-_hOoXzsWw_9-5-rgb_front	6.17	Or if I find that he's resisting, then I back off a little bit.
0-bR2rq-qps_0-5-rgb_front	5.08	HARMONIE KRIEGER: Astringent is really important and I don't think people do this enough.
0-bR2rq-qps_1-5-rgb_front	3.21	This is something that is so easy.
0-bR2rq-qps_10-5-rgb_front	5.04	So, you're going to take cotton swabs and you can use one or two.
0-bR2rq-qps_11-5-rgb_front	6.54	Now, the thing to be careful about astringent, it's very piercing to your skin.
0-bR2rq-qps_12-5-rgb_front	6.75	So, you feel kind of like a tingle so you don't want to put too much on it once.
0-bR2rq-qps_13-5-rgb_front	8.38	So, basically, you're going to just do a couple of drops almost like eye makeup remover.
0-bR2rq-qps_14-5-rgb_front	4.17	And you're going to take it and you're going to go all over the face.
0-bR2rq-qps_15-5-rgb_front	17.12	So, you're going to take this and you're going to rub it all over, everywhere
0-bR2rq-qps_16-5-rgb_front	11.21	Make sure you get every single place because this is what's going to clean all of the excess dirt that you didn't get with your exfoliator.
0-bR2rq-qps_17-5-rgb_front	7.62	So, even if you take a shower and you feel your face is super clean, always use the astringent after.
0-bR2rq-qps_18-5-rgb_front	8.0	And it does tingle but I like the tingle because it makes me feel that I'm getting all dirt off my face.
0-bR2rq-qps_19-5-rgb_front	1.71	Doesn't that feel refreshing?
0-bR2rq-qps_2-5-rgb_front	6.25	After you've washed your face or you come out of the shower, I love this because it's so refreshing.
0-bR2rq-qps_20-5-rgb_front	6.25	And then if you look at your cotton swab, you'll see just how much dirt you really have on your face.
0-bR2rq-qps_21-5-rgb_front	5.46	We won't look at yours, don't worry.
0-bR2rq-qps_22-5-rgb_front	2.38	And then just make sure you throw that away.
0-bR2rq-qps_23-5-rgb_front	3.88	And just have a stack of cotton swabs that you can always use.
0-bR2rq-qps_24-5-rgb_front	4.75	I always buy a pack of like a hundred or so and it looks like this.
0-bR2rq-qps_25-5-rgb_front	2.0	Again, I got this at Rite Aid.
0-bR2rq-qps_26-5-rgb_front	5.17	The whole package was a $1.99 and it will last to about two months.
0-bR2rq-qps_27-5-rgb_front	7.17	So again, use your astringent twice a day after the shower, after you wash your face.
0-bR2rq-qps_3-5-rgb_front	2.42	This is to prevent acne.
0-bR2rq-qps_4-5-rgb_front	3.79	Now, a lot of people need to prevent acne.
0-bR2rq-qps_5-5-rgb_front	4.5	And when they do have acne, it's a great way to prevent more acne.
0-bR2rq-qps_6-5-rgb_front	7.42	So, this is by Clean &amp
0-bR2rq-qps_7-5-rgb_front	8.96	Clean &amp
0-bR2rq-qps_8-5-rgb_front	5.62	Now, what you're going to do is make sure you have a bunch of cotton swabs.
0-bR2rq-qps_9-5-rgb_front	5.38	This is also a great way to take off your makeup and I'm going to show you that in a second.
0-n5YbN2IZA_0-5-rgb_front	8.42	Once we have sealed one end of the rain stick were ready to pour our rice inside and close off the other end.
0-n5YbN2IZA_1-5-rgb_front	19.29	The easiest way to do this is to put your rice into a plastic bag and then just put the mouth of the paper bag inside of the paper towel roll and tilt the bag over so all the rice will spill right inside.
0-n5YbN2IZA_10-5-rgb_front	15.5	So we go ahead and put it around and fold the excess right over the top and once we have gone around and we feel that its in place then we can go ahead and put some tape right along the bottom.
0-n5YbN2IZA_11-5-rgb_front	17.21	So now our rain stick has been totally sealed we have the rice inside and as we move it back and forth we'll see that it going to, its going to sound like the rain falling.
0-n5YbN2IZA_12-5-rgb_front	0.96	Hitting a window.
0-n5YbN2IZA_13-5-rgb_front	3.96	Hitting a roof or just falling outside.
0-n5YbN2IZA_14-5-rgb_front	27.75	So now I shown you how to place the rice inside our rain stick and seal the end with the lid and masking tape.
0-n5YbN2IZA_2-5-rgb_front	20.79	If you don't do it this way then you can use some type of funnel or something where the mouth fits inside the end of the rain stick and you can just pour the rice right inside.
0-n5YbN2IZA_3-5-rgb_front	1.67	But this is easiest way.
0-n5YbN2IZA_4-5-rgb_front	9.46	So once all the rice is inside were going to go ahead and seal the top of the stick.
0-n5YbN2IZA_5-5-rgb_front	18.5	We put the other lid the other circle that we cut out over the top and we do the same thing it should fit right on it shouldn't slip inside because of the thickness of the roll will help keep it on.
0-n5YbN2IZA_6-5-rgb_front	9.96	Just sitting on the outside and then we go ahead and take some masking tape and put it around the outside of the lid.
0-n5YbN2IZA_7-5-rgb_front	6.42	Around the roll and that helps create a seal.
0-n5YbN2IZA_8-5-rgb_front	9.75	We should put a few layers just like we did before and again this is going to help prevent any of the rice from falling out.
0-n5YbN2IZA_9-5-rgb_front	5.88	It creates a nice tight seal and really want to make sure that that lid stays place.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_0-5-rgb_front	3.25	The next thing we're going to do is we're going to stretch out our back.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_1-5-rgb_front	7.83	So anytime you work your abs, you want to stretch your back, work your back and then stretch your back out.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_10-5-rgb_front	2.25	But for right now, this is good.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_11-5-rgb_front	13.92	And once you've held this for about twenty to thirty seconds, you want to slowly come up, bring in your head up first, then your hands, then come back up to that seated position.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_12-5-rgb_front	5.62	And that is a great way to stretch out your abs and your back on the stability ball.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_2-5-rgb_front	4.33	So this is going to be a really great stretch for your abs and for your back.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_3-5-rgb_front	6.29	It's a modified back bend on the ball, it feels really great on your spine.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_4-5-rgb_front	2.83	And anybody of any age can do this.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_5-5-rgb_front	10.75	If you need some assistance, please use somebody to help you, if you're a little nervous or if you get sick going backwards, cause sometimes that can happen too.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_6-5-rgb_front	20.46	You want to take your feet, they're out, they're about hip width apart and you want to slowly go back, especially if you haven't done this before, rolling your butt forward, slowly come back, bring your hands down.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_7-5-rgb_front	15.38	Some people are going to be a little more nervous than others, but eventually what you want to do is you want to get both of your hands flat on the floor, just like this, and both of your feet are flat on the floor.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_8-5-rgb_front	11.0	Now different stability balls will give you different, different opportunities to stretch your back at different levels.
0-vrO9sZ5ow_9-5-rgb_front	10.29	This is actually really good what I have here, I could go for a little bit of a larger stability ball, but I wanted to go for a little bit of a deeper stretch.
0-wLoko5zNw_1-5-rgb_front	11.04	In this kitchen we're going to be putting down wood flooring and we need to calculate how much flooring to buy.
0-wLoko5zNw_2-5-rgb_front	22.71	The first thing I did was draw up a basic floor plan of the kitchen now my wood floors are going to go in the areas with red they do go below the stove and the fridge but not underneath the cabinetry.
0-wLoko5zNw_3-5-rgb_front	11.88	What I need to do to calculate the flooring is figure out the square footage so I'm going to break the kitchen up into four different sections.
0-wLoko5zNw_4-5-rgb_front	18.75	This one will be number one, number two, number three and number four I'm going to go through and measure the width and the length of each section and record the data.
0-wLoko5zNw_5-5-rgb_front	16.12	So what I done is come up with my four sections I've measured each section and wrote down my measurements on this last one it was 2.5 feet X 2 feet.
0-wLoko5zNw_6-5-rgb_front	12.38	I've then multiple those two measurements together which gave me my total square footage for each section.
0-wLoko5zNw_7-5-rgb_front	9.5	Then I'm going to go ahead and add all of those up and that's going to give me 73 square feet.
0-wLoko5zNw_8-5-rgb_front	21.79	Now it's always good to add about 15% to your materials for waist so I have my materials of 73 square feet, I'm going to add 15% so I'm going to multiple it by 1.15.
0-wLoko5zNw_9-5-rgb_front	14.33	That's going to give me a total of 83.95 square feet and I might as well rounded right up to 85 square feet.
0-zewtxhuR8_0-5-rgb_front	0.25	Hi!
0-zewtxhuR8_2-5-rgb_front	3.96	In this segment, we will be talking about supplies needed.
0-zewtxhuR8_3-5-rgb_front	5.29	The first thing that you will need will be the Galvanic Spa unit from Nu Skin.
0-zewtxhuR8_4-5-rgb_front	4.58	You will also need the treatment face gels.
0-zewtxhuR8_5-5-rgb_front	4.83	You will need the pretreatment and the treatment gel for the application.
0-zewtxhuR8_6-5-rgb_front	17.17	You will need scissors if going off site to open up the gels, cotton rounds to remove makeup, headband to keep the hair off the face, and a washcloth to cleanse the face in between applications.
0-zewtxhuR8_7-5-rgb_front	8.92	Always remember to have water because our hand will need to be moist at the back of the Galvanic Spa unit.
0-zewtxhuR8_8-5-rgb_front	3.0	Watch our next segment on reading the display.
001evy9D-mw_1-5-rgb_front	11.0	Now we're going to talk about the smallest of all of the stripes on the food pyramid, the yellow one right here which you can barely see.
001evy9D-mw_10-5-rgb_front	3.75	And that's all there is for the oils group.
001evy9D-mw_2-5-rgb_front	2.08	That is the oils food group.
001evy9D-mw_3-5-rgb_front	8.17	It's not technically a food group, but some oils an contribute to good health if you're getting the right ones.
001evy9D-mw_4-5-rgb_front	11.58	Healthy oils can be found in fish, nuts, corn oil, soybean oil, olive oil, or canola oil.
001evy9D-mw_5-5-rgb_front	10.04	Now most kids get enough of their daily intake from this category without actually having to make an effort to add things in.
001evy9D-mw_6-5-rgb_front	7.12	The recommended daily allowance for children four to five years old is four to five teaspoons.
001evy9D-mw_7-5-rgb_front	3.83	A teaspoon is that big.
001evy9D-mw_8-5-rgb_front	1.96	As you can see it's not very big.
001evy9D-mw_9-5-rgb_front	27.21	Now one teaspoon is half a tablespoon of mayo, half a tablespoon of margarine or butter, eight olives without the pits, one tablespoon of Italian salad dressing, or half an ounce of nuts.
002pHlZGEQ8_0-5-rgb_front	3.46	This edged weapon defense is a straight stab, once again.
002pHlZGEQ8_1-5-rgb_front	1.38	It's a wrist control.
002pHlZGEQ8_10-5-rgb_front	2.29	Now, I can either throw him to the ground.
002pHlZGEQ8_11-5-rgb_front	1.5	I can kick him in the leg.
002pHlZGEQ8_12-5-rgb_front	3.58	I can blast him in the side with the hilt of this other knife.
002pHlZGEQ8_13-5-rgb_front	5.0	The thousand things I can do, but before we do that we've got to get the knife away.
002pHlZGEQ8_14-5-rgb_front	1.33	So I'm, inside.
002pHlZGEQ8_15-5-rgb_front	1.33	He starts to pull it back.
002pHlZGEQ8_16-5-rgb_front	1.21	It's fine, I go with it.
002pHlZGEQ8_17-5-rgb_front	2.5	Here, I have the whole hand locked up.
002pHlZGEQ8_18-5-rgb_front	2.33	He's exposed, his center is raised up.
002pHlZGEQ8_19-5-rgb_front	5.75	Twist that, grab the blade here, turn it out of his hand.
002pHlZGEQ8_2-5-rgb_front	1.88	We previously went to the outside.
002pHlZGEQ8_20-5-rgb_front	6.62	More than likely, I would've simply throw him to the ground, project him as far away from me as possible.
002pHlZGEQ8_21-5-rgb_front	4.12	Before any of that happens, you've got to be off the line.
002pHlZGEQ8_22-5-rgb_front	2.71	He pulls back, and we go.
002pHlZGEQ8_23-5-rgb_front	12.38	Zonk you, for wrist control, inside wrist turn, pull it away, slam into the ground, and that is a good technique for an inside wrist control.
002pHlZGEQ8_3-5-rgb_front	3.92	Let's say, that we're going to be forced to the inside this time, and I come in.
002pHlZGEQ8_4-5-rgb_front	1.75	I still am going to hook it and catch it.
002pHlZGEQ8_5-5-rgb_front	1.92	I don't want catch the blade, obviously.
002pHlZGEQ8_6-5-rgb_front	1.83	That'll make for a short defense.
002pHlZGEQ8_7-5-rgb_front	2.75	I want to grab as much as I can here.
002pHlZGEQ8_8-5-rgb_front	5.79	Daniel's already spread out, but as with our other technique, he's not going to leave his hand out there.
002pHlZGEQ8_9-5-rgb_front	12.67	He's going to start to fight to get it back, and as he does, I'm going to go with him, and spiral that hand back around inside, turn this completely back into him and yank the knife away.
003D1CHLnQs_0-5-rgb_front	8.71	Let's do a quick example of the game, ship, captain, and crew, and then, for the rest of this series, we'll work on it in detail.
003D1CHLnQs_1-5-rgb_front	22.0	In a turn of ship, captain, and crew, you get three rolls, and you're trying to build first a ship, then have a captain assigned to it, and then collect a crew and then cargo.
003D1CHLnQs_10-5-rgb_front	11.79	And, it's six plus five, which is eleven, plus four which is fifteen, plus eight more, twenty-three.
003D1CHLnQs_11-5-rgb_front	0.88	And there you have it.
003D1CHLnQs_12-5-rgb_front	1.71	That's ship, captain, and crew.
003D1CHLnQs_13-5-rgb_front	2.79	We'll go into detail in this series.
003D1CHLnQs_2-5-rgb_front	5.75	Well, the ship equals number six.
003D1CHLnQs_3-5-rgb_front	3.08	On my first roll, I have no sixes.
003D1CHLnQs_4-5-rgb_front	4.25	So, I have to roll again.
003D1CHLnQs_5-5-rgb_front	4.71	Aha, there I rolled a six, so I have my ship.
003D1CHLnQs_6-5-rgb_front	4.25	Alas, there are no fives, no captain.
003D1CHLnQs_7-5-rgb_front	3.25	And, I only get one more roll, so let's hope this goes better.
003D1CHLnQs_8-5-rgb_front	29.33	Well, there's a five, so there is my captain and a die with four on it, equals the crew, and then once you have that, once you have ship, which is six, captain which is five, and crew which is four, you can use the remaining dice for your cargo.
003D1CHLnQs_9-5-rgb_front	8.71	In this case, it's a five and a three, and so now, I would score my points.
005j20-PoLw_0-5-rgb_front	0.29	O.k.
005j20-PoLw_1-5-rgb_front	19.67	now that we've got this set I'm going to go ahead and get the side walls a little damp.
005j20-PoLw_10-5-rgb_front	7.42	I can tell the thickness on the bottom was perfect because I can see this moving through the bottom, alright.
005j20-PoLw_11-5-rgb_front	8.88	And then you want to get it off the wheel head
005j20-PoLw_2-5-rgb_front	6.96	Alright, so picking it up just a little bit
005j20-PoLw_3-5-rgb_front	8.0	bring it up about right there
005j20-PoLw_4-5-rgb_front	9.42	It can be a little thinner on the inside but these rims right here
005j20-PoLw_5-5-rgb_front	18.54	At this point I got the height that I want and there's another things this tools great for
005j20-PoLw_6_7-5-rgb_front	31.08	Come in give it that classic casserole body right there
005j20-PoLw_8-5-rgb_front	20.0	With a form like this I don't like to get it too funky
005j20-PoLw_9-5-rgb_front	21.67	But that's it right there and you want to go ahead, take this tool
006DXpJ9erw_1-5-rgb_front	6.75	Now headshots are the most important thing that you can add to your resume in the industry.
006DXpJ9erw_2-5-rgb_front	21.92	You√¢¬Ä¬ôre not going to get anywhere without a headshot, they can tell you to take a couple of flashes, a couple of quick pictures and send it to them but ultimately they√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to come back and call you back and say, √¢¬Ä¬úhey you know what we need a professional headshot of you√¢¬Ä¬ù in order to submit it to their client.
006DXpJ9erw_3-5-rgb_front	10.46	So you want to make sure that you find a good photographer who is going to, look at their background history, who is going to take a professional headshot of you.
006DXpJ9erw_4-5-rgb_front	8.67	Not the school picture headshot, a professional acting modeling headshot.
006DXpJ9erw_5-5-rgb_front	14.96	Now the headshot is going to cover about that much of your head, its not a full body shot, its more like a √Ç¬æ length shot, you want to have your shoulders in the headshot in order to submit it.
006DXpJ9erw_6-5-rgb_front	8.29	You can submit it in either a black and white or a color but you want to have a headshot with your resume.
006DXpJ9erw_7-5-rgb_front	3.92	So make sure you find a good photographer, research them on the internet, maybe you know one in your town but make sure its professional.
006LlgDKKGM_0-5-rgb_front	14.83	How to master the tunnel technique just as I've mentioned previously with the over and the table command will come through dedication, commitment, routine and repetition.
006LlgDKKGM_1-5-rgb_front	9.17	After watching this video series you are going to understand and have a better idea of what agility is and how to prepare your dog.
006LlgDKKGM_2-5-rgb_front	33.75	I would suggest like I've mentioned be creative on your walks, find a parking curb, a picnic bench or a fallen log to practice over, a sewer block, a picnic table to practice the table and as far as the tunnel if you have any chairs in the home with an actual bed sheet you can practice that as a tunnel as well.
006LlgDKKGM_3-5-rgb_front	16.46	By exposing your dogs to these things every day they are going to become a lot less spooked and afraid and in no time will be hitting all of the obstacles on one simple run through.
006LlgDKKGM_4-5-rgb_front	20.62	As I mentioned with the tunnel it is best to start in small increments and do a little bit each day to ensure you don't spook your dog which will also get a better result when you begin them with agility tournaments.
00Cal635Wno_0-5-rgb_front	2.17	ALLYN CHRISTOPHER: All right, we're getting close.
00Cal635Wno_1-5-rgb_front	6.33	It's almost a completely brand new cleaner, just some of the exterior accessories and we're going to be ready to pick some dirt up.
00Cal635Wno_10-5-rgb_front	11.42	It actually goes over here and just sits on, and as you can tell by the fact that this is augered, we're just going to spin it on.
00Cal635Wno_11-5-rgb_front	14.62	Again, older frame, be careful, because this motion of the spinning could snap it here then you're into a whole other repair that includes glues and expoxys you've going to buy on your own, and also it's a nonsense.
00Cal635Wno_12-5-rgb_front	6.46	I'm going to leave it just about a finger's length away from the top of the mast.
00Cal635Wno_13-5-rgb_front	17.21	When you actually put this back in the pool and adjust and install like you did when it was new, you'll go through the process of seeing whether it's a little too way your center of floatness is in the right position.
00Cal635Wno_14-5-rgb_front	5.08	But once it's on there, it's nice and stiff and you're good to go, that's your float head.
00Cal635Wno_2-5-rgb_front	0.5	All right.
00Cal635Wno_3-5-rgb_front	1.17	Oh, actually heavy leaves.
00Cal635Wno_4-5-rgb_front	1.25	It's what it's designed for.
00Cal635Wno_5-5-rgb_front	0.33	All right.
00Cal635Wno_6-5-rgb_front	5.75	What I'm going to do here--this is a new float head.
00Cal635Wno_7-5-rgb_front	5.62	New float head, the old float head had water in it, sometimes that they get all cracked.
00Cal635Wno_8-5-rgb_front	8.25	I always like the fact that they'll get water in them and you'll splash them here and squeeze and the water doesn't come out.
00Cal635Wno_9-5-rgb_front	5.58	I don't know how gets in and why it isn't coming out, but that's for other minds to decide.
00DKFksyVnQ_0-5-rgb_front	11.71	Adobe Photoshop is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc., and I am in no way affiliated with Adobe.
00DKFksyVnQ_1-5-rgb_front	0.79	Ok, guys.
00DKFksyVnQ_10-5-rgb_front	11.62	So, what you can do is actually drop your opacity down to fifty percent and your spread to about sixteen pixels.
00DKFksyVnQ_11_12_13-5-rgb_front	18.04	Not your spread, I'm sorry. The size to about sixteen pixels and the spread at zero. So, as you can see, my-right here, distance: five
00DKFksyVnQ_14-5-rgb_front	1.67	"Now you're going to hit ""Ok""."
00DKFksyVnQ_15-5-rgb_front	3.71	I'm going to go over here up to the top, and you can see my piece of tape.
00DKFksyVnQ_16-5-rgb_front	4.25	It's starting to actually look like tape now.
00DKFksyVnQ_17-5-rgb_front	10.62	Now, what we're going to do is we're going to move on to the next clip, and I'm going to show you how to actually make little cuts into the tape to make it look even more realistic.
00DKFksyVnQ_2-5-rgb_front	7.17	On this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to make a drop shadow on your tape to make it look a little more realistic.
00DKFksyVnQ_3-5-rgb_front	6.04	"So, you want to make sure your ""Tape One"" layer is selected, as you can see right here."
00DKFksyVnQ_4-5-rgb_front	1.08	It's selected.
00DKFksyVnQ_5-5-rgb_front	8.83	You want to come down over here to your effects, layer style effects tool, and click.
00DKFksyVnQ_6-5-rgb_front	6.17	"Now, you can go either straight down to drop shadow, or you can actually hit ""Burning options""."
00DKFksyVnQ_7-5-rgb_front	1.58	"I'm just going to hit ""Drop shadow""."
00DKFksyVnQ_8-5-rgb_front	4.38	As you can see, it automatically brought me a drop shadow on my piece of tape.
00DKFksyVnQ_9-5-rgb_front	5.54	For some people, they would argue that that looks a little too much.
00Fc7cZX1gM_0-5-rgb_front	8.25	One of the main problems with illnesses in box turtles is going to be vitamin A deficiency.
00Fc7cZX1gM_1-5-rgb_front	5.17	This is the underlying cause of several different conditions that box turtles can get.
00Fc7cZX1gM_10-5-rgb_front	8.42	Her eyes were the only real apparent illness at the time, so that's what I was treating at the moment.
00Fc7cZX1gM_11-5-rgb_front	5.12	Then when I started seeing the bubbles coming from her nose, I realized there might be something more to it.
00Fc7cZX1gM_12-5-rgb_front	14.29	So after further research, I found that vitamin A deficiency fit all of the symptoms that she had and I immediately began to treat her for that condition.
00Fc7cZX1gM_13-5-rgb_front	4.83	Now, a good source of vitamin A, like I had mentioned before, is cod liver oil.
00Fc7cZX1gM_14-5-rgb_front	7.67	Added to her daily diet or at every feeding will prevent vitamin A deficiency.
00Fc7cZX1gM_15_16-5-rgb_front	20.17	Now in her case, I mega-dosed her with vitamin A. I had to receive veterinary care for her. She had to receive a shot of vitamin A, and she also had a fungus growing in her mouth and down her throat which caused her to lose her appetite completely.
00Fc7cZX1gM_17-5-rgb_front	3.21	So that led to the malnourishment.
00Fc7cZX1gM_18-5-rgb_front	10.96	And the antibiotics were used to treat the fungus and then the vitamin A injections, plus my care at home.
00Fc7cZX1gM_19-5-rgb_front	9.67	I had to force feed her for quite a while by sticking a tube down into her stomach with a mixture.
00Fc7cZX1gM_2-5-rgb_front	5.54	This turtle in particular, I got her as a rescue.
00Fc7cZX1gM_20-5-rgb_front	10.79	Which you can probably find on the Internet, some sort of force feeding recipe for any type of reptile that you may have.
00Fc7cZX1gM_21-5-rgb_front	4.58	Now she's completely well again.
00Fc7cZX1gM_22-5-rgb_front	6.71	This is something that is, this is the first time she's been healthy since I've had her.
00Fc7cZX1gM_23-5-rgb_front	7.83	And she looks wonderful now, but just in case, I always want to make sure I put the cod liver oil on her veggies.
00Fc7cZX1gM_24-5-rgb_front	3.17	That way I'm sure to not have this issue again.
00Fc7cZX1gM_3-5-rgb_front	11.88	She had been in a pet store that was abandoned and she was left without food and water, therefore she didn't have access to enough vitamin A.
00Fc7cZX1gM_4-5-rgb_front	5.21	By the time I received her, she was extremely dehydrated.
00Fc7cZX1gM_5-5-rgb_front	1.67	She was malnourished.
00Fc7cZX1gM_6-5-rgb_front	2.54	She was basically skin and bones.
00Fc7cZX1gM_7-5-rgb_front	6.46	Her eyes were infected, both of her eyes were infected and very pussy.
00Fc7cZX1gM_8-5-rgb_front	5.54	She has respiratory infection and she was just in horrible condition.
00Fc7cZX1gM_9-5-rgb_front	5.08	And so I treated her a long time by myself, just her eyes.
00T6xK82A7k_1-5-rgb_front	8.75	In these clips, we're going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace your vehicle's thermostat.
00T6xK82A7k_10-5-rgb_front	9.25	In order to remove the serpentine belt, what we have to do is release this spring-loaded tension that's applied by the tensioner.
00T6xK82A7k_11-5-rgb_front	4.96	The tensioner is spring-loaded in a clockwise direction.
00T6xK82A7k_12-5-rgb_front	9.0	As you can see, I have my double wrench here and you can see as I work it and let it go, the belt gets tighter and looser.
00T6xK82A7k_13-5-rgb_front	12.04	So, what I'm going to do is take and put enough tension on it so I can slip the belt off of my alternator and let it relax back down.
00T6xK82A7k_14-5-rgb_front	8.5	Once I have this guy out of the way, I can take and remove my belt.
00T6xK82A7k_15-5-rgb_front	10.5	Now, if my belt-not completely off of the engine but out of the way enough that I can get at the tensioner's mounting bolts.
00T6xK82A7k_16-5-rgb_front	4.33	There's one here and there's one here on the bottom.
00T6xK82A7k_17-5-rgb_front	8.42	I got my half-inch drive crafts and ratchet with my 17mm 12-point socket.
00T6xK82A7k_18-5-rgb_front	7.71	We'll take and slip it on the mounting bolt there and give it a pop to break it loose.
00T6xK82A7k_2-5-rgb_front	14.21	In this clip, we're going to talk about removing the serpentine belt and the serpentine belt tensioner in order to gain access to our vehicle's thermostat.
00T6xK82A7k_20-5-rgb_front	9.12	You're going to go ahead and repeat the same procedure for the other mounting bolts if there are any present.
00T6xK82A7k_3-5-rgb_front	5.58	This yellow component right here is my thermostat housing.
00T6xK82A7k_4-5-rgb_front	8.96	It's got a small portion of pipe on it as you can see and goes down to the actual housing here.
00T6xK82A7k_5-5-rgb_front	3.38	It has three bolts that hold it down.
00T6xK82A7k_6-5-rgb_front	7.58	And unfortunately enough, Ford decided to bury one of them behind my serpentine belt tensioner.
00T6xK82A7k_7-5-rgb_front	7.71	On your particular vehicle, you may not necessarily have to remove a serpentine belt tensioner.
00T6xK82A7k_8-5-rgb_front	13.62	However, you may have to remove, say an alternator or an A/C compressor, what I'm going to do is go over with you the general removal procedures for a couple of these devices.
00T6xK82A7k_9-5-rgb_front	6.17	In order to remove the serpentine belt, what you have to do is relax the tensioner.
00YBzfWomz8_0-5-rgb_front	3.08	Hi, the drink we're about to make is called Pineapple Cocktail.
00YBzfWomz8_1-5-rgb_front	5.5	Let's go ahead and put some ice in a glass here and measure out one shot of light rum.
00YBzfWomz8_10-5-rgb_front	8.04	And if you like you can garnish that with a pineapple or you can just serve it up as is.
00YBzfWomz8_11-5-rgb_front	0.96	Bottoms up.
00YBzfWomz8_2-5-rgb_front	26.08	With one ounce of light rum, two ounces of pineapple juice and one shot of lemon juice, one ounce and follow that up with a half a shot of grenadine which I have right here.
00YBzfWomz8_3-5-rgb_front	2.71	And we'll go ahead and shake that up.
00YBzfWomz8_4-5-rgb_front	6.33	Get everything mixed together.
00YBzfWomz8_5-5-rgb_front	2.5	There we go.
00YBzfWomz8_6-5-rgb_front	1.62	And we've got our glass here.
00YBzfWomz8_7-5-rgb_front	1.83	Let's go ahead and pour it in.
00YBzfWomz8_8-5-rgb_front	3.88	The last thing we'll do is just top it off with some club soda.
00YBzfWomz8_9-5-rgb_front	5.79	Alright, and we'll add a straw.
00kppw3aqus_0-3-rgb_front	4.63	I just want to say a little bit about allergic reactions and aroma therapies.
00kppw3aqus_1-3-rgb_front	7.3	You know most people they just enjoy the aroma therapies and they, they won't have any reaction.
00kppw3aqus_10-3-rgb_front	5.51	They're wonderful but you know use them, use them a little sparingly when you have to.
00kppw3aqus_11-3-rgb_front	16.22	The other thing to know is if there is any, if you are feeling disoriented or a little bit fuzzy headed or confused that could be a sign that you are getting a little bit high from the essential oil blends but not the right way.
00kppw3aqus_12-3-rgb_front	7.8	And so just kind of look for some of those signs and if you have any of them just stop using whatever it is.
00kppw3aqus_13-3-rgb_front	19.44	If it seems like it's still an agreeable formula for you to use, use it in a smaller amount, use it less frequently and you know use your best judgment and follow your intuition because aroma therapies they are very personal and you can kind of tell what is working for you and what's not.
00kppw3aqus_2-3-rgb_front	8.34	But one thing to bare in mind is everybody is different and the kinds of scents people like vary from one person to the next.
00kppw3aqus_3-3-rgb_front	4.75	It's just like getting a haircut, everybody wants something a little bit different but there are certain common themes.
00kppw3aqus_4-3-rgb_front	19.81	So really something to look out for when you are making aroma therapies is headaches, nausea, rashes, and even a kind of rash where maybe your whole, maybe your skin isn't totally broken out but your skin feels kind of a little bit dry or itchy.
00kppw3aqus_5-3-rgb_front	8.97	That might be an indication that you are either using the wrong aroma therapies or that you are using too much or that you are using them too frequently.
00kppw3aqus_6-3-rgb_front	9.01	For example if you're taking baths every night and you are putting you know essential oils into your bath every night, that is probably too much.
00kppw3aqus_7-3-rgb_front	3.71	You may toxify your system by using too much essential oil.
00kppw3aqus_8-3-rgb_front	4.42	Because again this is something that when it touches your skin, it's going into your blood stream.
00kppw3aqus_9-3-rgb_front	13.76	So you know if you love bath salts, maybe three nights a week is good, maybe four nights a week at the most but you got to give yourself a little time to rest and to not have to interact with the aroma therapies.
00m1mQFF5zo_0-3-rgb_front	4.0	Alright, now let's talk about taking messages.
00m1mQFF5zo_1-3-rgb_front	10.26	And your whole job might be about taking messages, or you might just simply answer the phone for another person, and you'll need to take a message for them.
00m1mQFF5zo_10-3-rgb_front	1.88	"I'll make sure that he gets the message."""
00m1mQFF5zo_11-3-rgb_front	5.26	And then, you have to make sure that that person gets the message.
00m1mQFF5zo_12-3-rgb_front	4.5	It's very, very important that business messages not get dropped through the cracks.
00m1mQFF5zo_13-3-rgb_front	10.51	So take accurate information and pass the message on, immediately, not three days later, but immediately after you record the message.
00m1mQFF5zo_2-3-rgb_front	8.09	It is absolutely crucial that you get a certain amount of information from the person on the other end of the phone.
00m1mQFF5zo_3-3-rgb_front	3.17	And the information must be accurate.
00m1mQFF5zo_4-3-rgb_front	11.34	You need to have their name, the business that they're calling from, if that's applicable, the telephone number, and a brief message.
00m1mQFF5zo_5-3-rgb_front	3.17	Now, I said it is crucial that this information be accurate.
00m1mQFF5zo_6-3-rgb_front	2.0	Well, how do you make sure it's accurate?
00m1mQFF5zo_7-3-rgb_front	1.13	You repeat it.
00m1mQFF5zo_8-3-rgb_front	15.06	"""Okay, this is John Smith from XYZ Corporation, and your phone number is 872-939-4086, and you want to talk to Bob about the planning meeting on Friday."
00m1mQFF5zo_9-3-rgb_front	0.75	Okay, great.
00xgNW3M4-4_0-3-rgb_front	3.29	Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com.
00xgNW3M4-4_1-3-rgb_front	4.92	And in this segment we're going to learn about how to plant sunflowers.
00xgNW3M4-4_10-3-rgb_front	8.43	The easiest way that I found to grow seeds is to take the container and open it up.
00xgNW3M4-4_11_12-3-rgb_front	28.9	Then take a napkin or a paper towel and put some seeds into there. And once you've got them into the middle kind of spread them out just a bit because you don't want to be too crowded and then I double it up, and I'll wet that down and then put it into a plastic bag.
00xgNW3M4-4_13-3-rgb_front	1.88	And leave it in the house in a warm spot.
00xgNW3M4-4_14-3-rgb_front	2.54	So the best time to do this is April or May of every year.
00xgNW3M4-4_15-3-rgb_front	2.92	You can also grow a second crop of sunflowers into the summer.
00xgNW3M4-4_16-3-rgb_front	3.25	So you can start another crop of them in July and August as well.
00xgNW3M4-4_17-3-rgb_front	6.63	But the first crop I usually start in April, May and I give it water, put some water in it and leave it just in a drawer.
00xgNW3M4-4_18-3-rgb_front	8.09	And then I'll check on it every couple days and eventually the little seed will start growing, and you'll see just a little sprout.
00xgNW3M4-4_19-3-rgb_front	4.17	And it is at that time I take the sprouts and I put them right into the ground.
00xgNW3M4-4_2-3-rgb_front	2.46	So there's different ways that you can buy your sunflowers.
00xgNW3M4-4_20-3-rgb_front	4.21	And make sure the green is out of the ground and the roots are covered, and I just cover them up.
00xgNW3M4-4_21-3-rgb_front	2.04	And they will grow very quickly from there.
00xgNW3M4-4_22-3-rgb_front	4.88	You just put some seed starter mix in here and sprinkle just a few seeds in each one.
00xgNW3M4-4_23-3-rgb_front	2.42	And give it lots of water and make sure to mist it.
00xgNW3M4-4_24-3-rgb_front	6.21	Don't just pour water on it, the key is to mist the starter, mist the seeds and they'll start growing.
00xgNW3M4-4_25-3-rgb_front	3.55	And once they get a pretty good root base then I'll turn around and plant them in the ground.
00xgNW3M4-4_26-3-rgb_front	2.71	Either way I've had great success with sunflowers.
00xgNW3M4-4_27-3-rgb_front	4.38	I've put them right into the ground before and I didn't even start them ahead of time, and they've grown well.
00xgNW3M4-4_28-3-rgb_front	1.63	These came in from the neighbor's yard.
00xgNW3M4-4_29-3-rgb_front	1.96	The birds brought them or they just flew over here.
00xgNW3M4-4_3-3-rgb_front	10.47	A lot of times you buy them in containers already growing and when they're already growing you really don't have too much but turn around and transplant that pot right into the ground.
00xgNW3M4-4_30-3-rgb_front	3.21	Either way they're so easy to grow and such a rewarding plant.
00xgNW3M4-4_4-3-rgb_front	2.75	So just make sure that it gets enough sun.
00xgNW3M4-4_5-3-rgb_front	2.21	That's the key
00xgNW3M4-4_6-3-rgb_front	2.04	Sunflowers will not do well in the shade.
00xgNW3M4-4_7-3-rgb_front	3.38	When you purchase a sunflower in a pot they're easy, you just transplant them.
00xgNW3M4-4_8-3-rgb_front	8.47	You can leave them in the pot or you can put them right into the ground either way but make sure that you leave the dirt around the root so that they don't get too dried out.
00xgNW3M4-4_9-3-rgb_front	4.75	When you're growing sunflowers from seed there's a lot of easy tricks that you can do.
01Dnm-s8rNI_0-3-rgb_front	0.92	Hi, I'm Jeanette Welker.
01Dnm-s8rNI_1-3-rgb_front	9.33	I'm a Family Nurse Practitioner, practicing in Eugene, Oregon, at Oregon Optimal Health, and I can tell you about one of the funniest times that I came to work.
01Dnm-s8rNI_2-3-rgb_front	7.67	The very first job that I got as a Nurse Practitioner, was with the University of New Mexico, in their Maternity and Infant Care Project.
01Dnm-s8rNI_3-3-rgb_front	17.17	Doing that particular job, we did not only prenatal care for pregnant women, but we also were able to do Wellness, follow up visits for their babies and infants, up to the age, of about two years of age.
01Dnm-s8rNI_4-3-rgb_front	9.83	I arrived early in a rural part of New Mexico, to do cancer screening, and opened up the doors, and lo and behold, there were two clients already waiting there for me.
01Dnm-s8rNI_5-3-rgb_front	2.29	They were bats attached to the walls.
01Dnm-s8rNI_6-3-rgb_front	13.71	I had to get brooms out and encourage them to go outward, so that we could bring our real clients in, and that was the start of a day of, a batty start to a day.
01G_nWgaYAQ_1-3-rgb_front	3.46	Today I would be talking about how to tack up a horse.
01G_nWgaYAQ_10-3-rgb_front	6.92	As you put the nose band on, the nose band should be snugged.
01G_nWgaYAQ_11-3-rgb_front	12.04	As we put the throat latch on, you still want to be able to fit about a fist right here.
01G_nWgaYAQ_12-3-rgb_front	7.5	It is important that you don't make this one too tight cause then when they go to flex, it can cut off some circulation.
01G_nWgaYAQ_2-3-rgb_front	4.79	Now that the bridle is on, you want to make sure that it is fitted well.
01G_nWgaYAQ_3-3-rgb_front	6.12	You want to make sure that the bit is high enough, that there is 2-3 wrinkle in the corner of his mouth.
01G_nWgaYAQ_4-3-rgb_front	3.88	Right now there is non.
01G_nWgaYAQ_5-3-rgb_front	9.21	So tighten that up.
01G_nWgaYAQ_6-3-rgb_front	9.29	So now you can see that there is wrinkles in the corner of his mouth and it always important to put the pieces in the keepers.
01G_nWgaYAQ_7-3-rgb_front	8.54	Now adjusting the nose band, you want to make sure that the nose band goes underneath the cheek pieces.
01G_nWgaYAQ_8-3-rgb_front	4.75	It is just a little higher of the bit but just underneath his cheek bone there.
01G_nWgaYAQ_9-3-rgb_front	6.5	So I'm going to put that up a couple of holes once again tucking each piece under its keeper.
01KR04fE7Fw_0-3-rgb_front	0.33	Hi!
01KR04fE7Fw_2-3-rgb_front	7.62	I'm soaking my feet in a plain plastic basin with the Epsom salt in bath temperature water.
01KR04fE7Fw_3-3-rgb_front	11.79	You could also purchase basin that plug into the wall that have a warmer in them and vibrate and tingle your feet which also feels really really good to your feet.
01KR04fE7Fw_4-3-rgb_front	8.62	You soak for about 10-15 minutes although you want to stay longer because it feels so good.
01KR04fE7Fw_5-3-rgb_front	18.46	But, I have been here for about 15 minutes and now I'm going to take one of my feet out of the water and use the pumice stone on the heels and just scrap the dead skin of the heels.
01KR04fE7Fw_6-3-rgb_front	13.21	Because I have soaked and because I have used the Epsom salt the pumice stone works really well removing the dead skin and makes the heels feel very very soft.
01KR04fE7Fw_7-3-rgb_front	9.67	I will continue on doing this one sometimes you have dry skin and person has dry skin up in this area from shoes.
01KR04fE7Fw_8-3-rgb_front	5.29	Basically you could do the right foot and I will continue on with the other one.
01j1UveqztE_0-3-rgb_front	3.42	We are talking about the home office and how to be productive.
01j1UveqztE_1-3-rgb_front	3.46	So for me I've found that environment is very important.
01j1UveqztE_10-3-rgb_front	11.33	I got things done but I can tell you it wasn't nearly to the level where I am able to be productive now so I would highly recommend even if you don't have an entire room that you can stake out for yourself.
01j1UveqztE_11-3-rgb_front	1.75	I do think that is idea.
01j1UveqztE_12-3-rgb_front	5.29	Even if you can't do that though, make sure that there is a corner or an area of the house that is yours.
01j1UveqztE_13-3-rgb_front	1.5	That is your work station.
01j1UveqztE_14-3-rgb_front	22.17	That is where you go when you are working and that your family and your loved ones, your children, whoever might be a distraction know that when you are there working, you're working and that is your work time and just kind of, if you set those boundaries right from the start then it should be a lot easier for you down the road and when you sit there you will have that psychological trigger of oh, this is my work station, this is where I work.
01j1UveqztE_15-3-rgb_front	2.33	It just kind of helps you over time be a lot more productive.
01j1UveqztE_2-3-rgb_front	8.88	When I first started working remotely or from home I found that I just kind of would work wherever I could.
01j1UveqztE_3-3-rgb_front	0.92	I had a laptop.
01j1UveqztE_4-3-rgb_front	20.42	I was sitting on the couch with the TV on one day and maybe I would be sitting in my room writing, typing while I am sitting on my bed another day and what I came to find out was that just really wasn't conducive for me being productive so what I did was I got a room all to myself.
01j1UveqztE_5-3-rgb_front	1.04	This is my home office.
01j1UveqztE_6-3-rgb_front	2.58	I designate it as my space.
01j1UveqztE_7-3-rgb_front	5.62	I decorated it the way I wanted to in a way that made me feel calm and allows me to think clearly.
01j1UveqztE_8-3-rgb_front	4.25	I think that environment is very important for productivity.
01j1UveqztE_9-3-rgb_front	6.46	Looking back I don't even know how I got anything done sitting on the couch with people walking around, talking to me, interrupting me.
01m9yM04RwY_0-3-rgb_front	3.12	Okay, the drink we're about to make is called Emerald Isle Cocktail.
01m9yM04RwY_1-3-rgb_front	4.04	And this is going to be served as a martini, up, with no ice.
01m9yM04RwY_10-3-rgb_front	5.21	Since we're serving it up, want to make sure you shake it very well before you pour.
01m9yM04RwY_11-3-rgb_front	0.96	And that'll do it.
01m9yM04RwY_11_12_13_14_15-3-rgb_front	12.42	And that'll do it. Go ahead and grab your glass. And strainer. And pour it in. Got a nice, pretty green color.
01m9yM04RwY_12-3-rgb_front	1.71	Go ahead and grab your glass.
01m9yM04RwY_13-3-rgb_front	0.67	And strainer.
01m9yM04RwY_14-3-rgb_front	0.92	And pour it in.
01m9yM04RwY_15-3-rgb_front	3.17	Got a nice, pretty green color.
01m9yM04RwY_16-3-rgb_front	1.0	There we go.
01m9yM04RwY_17-3-rgb_front	1.12	That'll do it.
01m9yM04RwY_18-3-rgb_front	1.42	Emerald Isle Cocktail.
01m9yM04RwY_19-3-rgb_front	0.67	Bottoms up.
01m9yM04RwY_2-3-rgb_front	6.67	So if you get your martini glass ready with some water and ice in it, let that sit for about thirty seconds, and it'll be nice and chilled when you're ready to serve.
01m9yM04RwY_3-3-rgb_front	2.88	All right, measure out two ounces of gin.
01m9yM04RwY_4-3-rgb_front	0.67	There we go.
01m9yM04RwY_5-3-rgb_front	3.58	And follow that up with a half a shot of green creme de menthe.
01m9yM04RwY_6-3-rgb_front	3.83	And last we will add three dashes of bitters.
01m9yM04RwY_7-3-rgb_front	4.04	There's one, two, and three.
01m9yM04RwY_8-3-rgb_front	1.38	Now, let's mix this up real well.
01m9yM04RwY_9-3-rgb_front	0.88	Get it nice and cold.
01okYWMvD-0_0-3-rgb_front	6.46	Hello, my name is Sophia, I own the salon in Austin, Texas, Sophia Beauty Barber Salon.
01okYWMvD-0_1-3-rgb_front	7.5	A lot of people, they have problems with back wrinkles and how we could remove back wrinkles perfectly.
01okYWMvD-0_2-3-rgb_front	4.75	A lot of things on the market, some people get confused.
01okYWMvD-0_3-3-rgb_front	8.62	And one of the best back wrinkle remover is the anti-aging cream and it's from Energy, it's on of the best.
01okYWMvD-0_4-3-rgb_front	16.71	And also you could you use Aloe-Vera sometimes to remove the back wrinkle and sometimes we could use vitamin E, vitamin E is perfect way for the, removes the back wrinkles.
01okYWMvD-0_5-3-rgb_front	13.38	And that's the way you could remove the back wrinkles, Energy, Aloe-Vera, vitamin E is one of the best in the market today we could trust.
01ucR6XreJw_1-5-rgb_front	0.96	My name is Brandon.
01ucR6XreJw_10-5-rgb_front	5.92	Take the very end of the rope, pass it to the front of the loop, pull through.
01ucR6XreJw_11-5-rgb_front	3.12	When you pull the knot tight, it should come out looking like an 8.
01ucR6XreJw_12-5-rgb_front	1.67	This called the figure 8 knot.
01ucR6XreJw_13-5-rgb_front	6.17	What you're going to do next is retrace this knot to your harness tying yourself in.
01ucR6XreJw_3-5-rgb_front	2.42	The first step to getting on the wall is to tie in.
01ucR6XreJw_4-5-rgb_front	5.83	When you approach the wall, look up, separate the ropes and grab the rope closest the wall.
01ucR6XreJw_5-5-rgb_front	1.54	This is going to be the climber's rope.
01ucR6XreJw_6-5-rgb_front	4.12	Next, grab the very end of that rope in your right hand.
01ucR6XreJw_7-5-rgb_front	2.0	Pull an arm's span of slack through.
01ucR6XreJw_8-5-rgb_front	6.46	Next step, make a pinch in the rope with the end of the rope on the right side and drop it from your right hand.
01ucR6XreJw_9-5-rgb_front	8.29	Double check to make certain that the end of the rope is in the right side of the loop, wrap the rope clock wise around the loop.
025gAKRCIKY_0_1-3-rgb_front	5.92	How are you doing my name is Lars Eric Robinson I'm with LarsEr Arts All Around Art-tainment. I'm a freelance illustrator.
025gAKRCIKY_10-3-rgb_front	7.04	It should come straight off, there's other cleaning mediums out there that you can look for too, they have a powder form that should be able to take your paint right off.
025gAKRCIKY_11-3-rgb_front	4.5	Hope that explains to you what we go through as artists to try to get our paint off our clothes.
025gAKRCIKY_12-3-rgb_front	0.75	Thank you so much.
025gAKRCIKY_2-3-rgb_front	7.21	Today I'm going to talk about something that's you probably want to know about if you are painting and you are working and you are having clothes and you don't want to get anything on it.
025gAKRCIKY_3-3-rgb_front	4.21	As you can tell right here I have a paint stain right here on my pants.
025gAKRCIKY_4-3-rgb_front	5.75	You take mineral spirits, the same medium thinner that you are using for your oils.
025gAKRCIKY_5-3-rgb_front	2.17	You dab it on both sides, you put it on there.
025gAKRCIKY_6-3-rgb_front	2.92	Once you notice it dropped on there, you let it soak.
025gAKRCIKY_7-3-rgb_front	10.54	Then maybe when you are done at the end of the day, you could take this same stain that you have on there, and you put your dish washing soap on both sides and rub it in.
025gAKRCIKY_8-3-rgb_front	2.33	And then wash it, just like a normal clothes.
025gAKRCIKY_9-3-rgb_front	15.17	It should definitely be able to come out, so just remember you use this paint thinner that you had, that you were painting with and just dab it on there, you can scrub it a little bit and then when you are done just wash it like a normal clothes.
028cpYJmYAk_1-8-rgb_front	1.17	My name is Leta Koontz.
028cpYJmYAk_10-8-rgb_front	0.96	To come out of the pose just release your fingers and release your foot.
028cpYJmYAk_2-8-rgb_front	5.21	I'm a yoga instructor at Schoolhouse Yoga located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
028cpYJmYAk_4-8-rgb_front	0.75	Mermaid pose.
028cpYJmYAk_5-8-rgb_front	3.62	From here, you're going to bring your right knee in front of you.
028cpYJmYAk_6-8-rgb_front	4.25	Again, keeping the belly drawn in, you're going to reach back and take your left ankle.
028cpYJmYAk_7-8-rgb_front	3.96	Start to draw the heel of your left foot in towards your left hip.
028cpYJmYAk_8-8-rgb_front	3.33	You can stay here for a breath or two to get a nice long quadricep.
028cpYJmYAk_9-8-rgb_front	7.54	Then you can bring the hand into the armpit or into the edge of the elbow, bring your right hand back, release your fingers, and look forward.
02CpakICRL4_1-8-rgb_front	5.42	Learning the cross body throw begins with grip the thumb is on the top, and the fingers are on the bottom.
02CpakICRL4_2-8-rgb_front	7.54	You can extend your index finger out on the side when you release the outside edge the edge away from your hand should be up.
02CpakICRL4_3-8-rgb_front	7.92	This edge cuts into the air and gives the disc it's lift the arm and follow through point towards the target.
02CpakICRL4_4-8-rgb_front	7.54	This throw put right spin on the disc for a lefty all the right and left things are opposite.
02CpakICRL4_5-8-rgb_front	13.75	The legs make a line into the target when we release our right foot is forward this is probably the most common throw in the one that most of us start with.
02CpakICRL4_6-8-rgb_front	8.79	By throwing the cross body like slightly up hill sort of speak it slows the disc down and makes it easier to catch and do tricks.
02CpakICRL4_7-8-rgb_front	10.79	Using a pass catch we can get set up for the cross body throw for the pass catch just step aside and as it's passing you grab it on the back side.
02CpakICRL4_8-8-rgb_front	5.75	I'll cover it in detail in another clip this is a great throw when your playing close together.
02LnULLXds4_0-8-rgb_front	1.38	Color is relative!
02LnULLXds4_1-8-rgb_front	3.54	And that is the one rule that you really need to remember.
02LnULLXds4_10-8-rgb_front	4.12	But in a different ground, this pink looks different.
02LnULLXds4_11-8-rgb_front	2.88	That means that you've got an awful lot of color testing in front of you.
02LnULLXds4_12-8-rgb_front	4.5	I'm just going to show you again a dark pink here.
02LnULLXds4_13-8-rgb_front	2.04	And again the same thing happens.
02LnULLXds4_14-8-rgb_front	1.42	This is looking more purple.
02LnULLXds4_15-8-rgb_front	1.79	This is looking very purple actually.
02LnULLXds4_16-8-rgb_front	2.04	And this again looks more orange.
02LnULLXds4_17-8-rgb_front	4.29	This is, happens something to do A with the fact that the colors are mixed.
02LnULLXds4_18-8-rgb_front	3.08	I mean the blue is straight out of the jar as is the red.
02LnULLXds4_19-8-rgb_front	1.62	The pink I had to mix.
02LnULLXds4_2-8-rgb_front	6.0	Every time you change a color, in a painting you change everything else that is happening around it.
02LnULLXds4_20-8-rgb_front	1.33	Now I mixed the pink with white.
02LnULLXds4_21-8-rgb_front	1.21	You know got to get it lighter.
02LnULLXds4_22-8-rgb_front	1.46	And I put in a little blue.
02LnULLXds4_23-8-rgb_front	10.42	What happens is, the red sucks up all the colors in the light spectrum except red.
02LnULLXds4_24-8-rgb_front	4.21	Then you've got this on top, and it's going to respond more blue.
02LnULLXds4_25-8-rgb_front	4.12	On the blue where every color but blue is being sucked up.
02LnULLXds4_26-8-rgb_front	1.96	Then this responds differently.
02LnULLXds4_27-8-rgb_front	3.58	There is sort of no more blue, so it becomes more on the orange side.
02LnULLXds4_28-8-rgb_front	11.04	So weather it's a dark or a light color, the fact that it's a mixed color, when it's next to something different.
02LnULLXds4_29-8-rgb_front	2.17	Again I'm going to move this down here.
02LnULLXds4_3-8-rgb_front	2.04	This is just a very simple test.
02LnULLXds4_30-8-rgb_front	1.25	That's the same color.
02LnULLXds4_31-8-rgb_front	2.08	But you wouldn't think it to look up here.
02LnULLXds4_32-8-rgb_front	5.67	So that's the foot of the very basic idea behind color adjust position.
02LnULLXds4_4-8-rgb_front	3.46	This color looks sort of like a blue pink.
02LnULLXds4_5-8-rgb_front	2.75	This looks kind of like a orange corral pink.
02LnULLXds4_6-8-rgb_front	2.0	These are in fact the same pink.
02LnULLXds4_7-8-rgb_front	0.67	Let me prove it.
02LnULLXds4_8-8-rgb_front	2.5	The same pink!
02LnULLXds4_9-8-rgb_front	2.29	I cut them off out, off of the same stripe.
02M-Xcs3X30_0-3-rgb_front	4.25	Hi, I'm William Richey, I'm the executive manager for American Eagle Security in Springfield Oregon.
02M-Xcs3X30_1-3-rgb_front	5.29	The reason I became a security officer was to use it as a stepping stone to get into law enforcement.
02M-Xcs3X30_2-3-rgb_front	7.92	A lot of people when they get out of high school, or out of college, or right out of the military, want to work in law enforcement.
02M-Xcs3X30_3-3-rgb_front	14.08	And security is a good stepping stone, it gets them out onto the street, it gets them some experience, dealing with the public, and seeing the type of crimes that happens, and helps them with their career path moving towards law enforcement.
02M-Xcs3X30_4-3-rgb_front	7.42	I myself ended up enjoying security so much that I ended up making it a career, and never pursued the law enforcement aspect of it.
02M-Xcs3X30_5-3-rgb_front	7.75	And I've been doing security now for about 15 years, and I've enjoyed every year of it.
02M-Xcs3X30_6-3-rgb_front	2.21	And that's why I became a security officer.
02QGTJlJYnM_0-8-rgb_front	4.62	I'm now going to pursue working on Pam's bikini line.
02QGTJlJYnM_1-8-rgb_front	6.58	In many times, incidences in my salon I have women that want all the hair off.
02QGTJlJYnM_10-8-rgb_front	4.46	But the nice thing about Pam is that she has light skin.
02QGTJlJYnM_11-8-rgb_front	1.88	So this would work on a laser.
02QGTJlJYnM_12-8-rgb_front	5.17	But not at the best potential like a white skinned person and a dark, dark haired person.
02QGTJlJYnM_13-8-rgb_front	1.75	So she wants electrology.
02QGTJlJYnM_14-8-rgb_front	1.17	She really believes in it.
02QGTJlJYnM_15-8-rgb_front	3.54	She's had great success with it and that's what we're going to do.
02QGTJlJYnM_16-8-rgb_front	6.42	So now we're just going to slide each one of these down, this probe, down each one of these follicles.
02QGTJlJYnM_17-8-rgb_front	1.62	And this hair is a little heavier.
02QGTJlJYnM_18-8-rgb_front	2.71	And this is they call terminal sexual hair.
02QGTJlJYnM_19-8-rgb_front	2.04	It's deeper and it's a little stronger.
02QGTJlJYnM_2-8-rgb_front	10.96	And when the hair is dark, like I said before, I'm going to tell them I think, and this is my opinion, I think laser is going to be the better choice for you.
02QGTJlJYnM_20-8-rgb_front	6.42	As you can see if I was to hold up that hair, that it's deeper than a lot of the other hairs in the body.
02QGTJlJYnM_21-8-rgb_front	9.21	If you measure on the probe how deep it is, so that tells you just how deep your insertion should be.
02QGTJlJYnM_3-8-rgb_front	9.5	But when it's a woman that has sporadic hair on the side or here and there, strays and some cleanup work, I would advise electrology.
02QGTJlJYnM_4-8-rgb_front	7.21	And especially if that hair is light in color because energy of a laser is not going to work on lighter hair.
02QGTJlJYnM_5-8-rgb_front	9.67	It doesn't have the melanin for the laser to be attracted to it and cause the heat to go into the follicle and destroy the germitive cells.
02QGTJlJYnM_6-8-rgb_front	6.17	But when it comes to electrology, each hair no matter what the color is, it's going to work on.
02QGTJlJYnM_7-8-rgb_front	4.88	So in that fashion we're going to go in and we're going to look, assess the area.
02QGTJlJYnM_8-8-rgb_front	2.29	Pam's hair is not very dark.
02QGTJlJYnM_9-8-rgb_front	2.33	It really is kind of a dark blonde.
02WRxAwx-Bo_1-8-rgb_front	3.29	Now, I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite holiday punches.
02WRxAwx-Bo_10-8-rgb_front	1.67	And, we're going to get our wooden spoon.
02WRxAwx-Bo_11-8-rgb_front	1.92	Just mix all of the ingredients together.
02WRxAwx-Bo_12-8-rgb_front	1.88	So, you can get acquainted with one another.
02WRxAwx-Bo_13-8-rgb_front	6.88	And, we're going to take it over to our stove top where our sauce pan will be ready to go and on medium.
02WRxAwx-Bo_14-8-rgb_front	1.29	Let's go over there.
02WRxAwx-Bo_15-8-rgb_front	6.5	So, in the pan we're going to be heating our four cups of cranberry juice with the cloves, the hint of nutmeg and the cinnamon sticks.
02WRxAwx-Bo_16-8-rgb_front	2.88	And, we're going to add some honey.
02WRxAwx-Bo_17-8-rgb_front	5.08	We need to make sure that we stir until the honey as completely dissolved.
02WRxAwx-Bo_18-8-rgb_front	3.04	And, of course the juice is nice and warm.
02WRxAwx-Bo_19-8-rgb_front	0.88	That should be enough.
02WRxAwx-Bo_2-8-rgb_front	4.75	This is called the non-alcoholic Spiced Punch and it's very quick and easy to make.
02WRxAwx-Bo_20-8-rgb_front	2.71	But, if you like honey, feel free to add a little more.
02WRxAwx-Bo_21-8-rgb_front	15.25	Now, we're going to bring the punch over to our bowl.
02WRxAwx-Bo_22-8-rgb_front	11.58	Make sure you do it very gently, so you don't get burned.
02WRxAwx-Bo_23-8-rgb_front	3.17	The non-alcoholic Spiced Punch serves six to eight people.
02WRxAwx-Bo_24-8-rgb_front	7.54	And, typically it would be served in a mug or a teacup garnished with about two little sticks of cinnamon and that's it.
02WRxAwx-Bo_25-8-rgb_front	1.88	The non-alcoholic Spiced Punch.
02WRxAwx-Bo_3-8-rgb_front	0.96	But, so good.
02WRxAwx-Bo_4-8-rgb_front	11.83	You're going to need four cups of cranberry juice, honey just for the taste, a few sticks of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and about three to four cloves.
02WRxAwx-Bo_5-8-rgb_front	3.96	Now, I'm going to bring over here my punch bowl to mix all the things in.
02WRxAwx-Bo_6-8-rgb_front	3.17	And, you can start your stove top at about medium.
02WRxAwx-Bo_7-8-rgb_front	11.62	Now, I'm going to mix the two cinnamon sticks with the four cups of cranberry juice.
02WRxAwx-Bo_8-8-rgb_front	9.08	Like I said, just a little hint of nutmeg and a few cloves.
02WRxAwx-Bo_9-8-rgb_front	0.46	Like so.
02aFykvwx6M_0-8-rgb_front	2.96	Off season training for football
02aFykvwx6M_1-8-rgb_front	4.38	Right now we are going to do another superset, a combination of burpies and sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_10-8-rgb_front	2.25	Jones is going to take it at full speed.
02aFykvwx6M_11-8-rgb_front	1.25	We're working down and up.
02aFykvwx6M_12-8-rgb_front	1.58	We're going to do ten and ten.
02aFykvwx6M_13-8-rgb_front	0.96	He's going to do ten burpies.
02aFykvwx6M_14-8-rgb_front	4.33	We're going to do five and five.
02aFykvwx6M_15-8-rgb_front	9.12	We're going to do a combination of five burpies for ten sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_16-8-rgb_front	2.54	We want to repeat this for five sets.
02aFykvwx6M_17-8-rgb_front	7.62	We'll be doing five burpies and ten sit-ups each set for a total of twenty-five burpies and fifty sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_18-8-rgb_front	2.71	That's for our superset of burpies and sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_19-8-rgb_front	5.88	Next we are going to work on some exercises, single leg exercises that will help develop stability and agility.
02aFykvwx6M_2-8-rgb_front	2.83	Jones is going to demonstrate what a burpie is.
02aFykvwx6M_3-8-rgb_front	1.29	Can we take it slow real fast?
02aFykvwx6M_4-8-rgb_front	12.21	We want to hit the ground and then jump back into a plank position lowered down for a push-up and then we're going to spring forward and then get into a squat, deep squat position and then we finish by ending up on top.
02aFykvwx6M_5-8-rgb_front	4.12	Then we are going to combine that with sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_6-8-rgb_front	1.62	Can you show us some sit-ups, please?
02aFykvwx6M_7-8-rgb_front	1.71	Jones is showing us what we mean about sit-ups.
02aFykvwx6M_8-8-rgb_front	9.21	We are going to work full sit-ups so that we're getting the hip flexors involved and when we come up on top we open up the chest, open up the shoulders and push the chest out.
02aFykvwx6M_9-8-rgb_front	1.96	Now we are going to work a combination of it.
02gzHnpz1W4_0-8-rgb_front	5.25	Now I'm going to demonstrate the double figure of eight hitch, loop
02gzHnpz1W4_1-8-rgb_front	1.92	Its really just a constrictor knot is all it is.
02gzHnpz1W4_10-8-rgb_front	5.08	Now what I'm going to do is since my overhand loop, my initial loop I created, my working end.
02gzHnpz1W4_11-8-rgb_front	5.08	Bring it back around and create another loop here, another just overhand loop.
02gzHnpz1W4_12-8-rgb_front	5.0	And then I'm going to take my standing end that I have here and we'll bring it back around as well.
02gzHnpz1W4_13-8-rgb_front	3.29	And we'll create another overhand loop as well on the other side.
02gzHnpz1W4_14-8-rgb_front	9.21	Now, how this is going to be used is, I'm going to take my block of wood here, and I'm going to pick both of these pieces up and I'm going to slide my wood through.
02gzHnpz1W4_15-8-rgb_front	2.88	And I'm just going to pull them through, like so.
02gzHnpz1W4_16-8-rgb_front	2.5	And constrict these knots around this piece of wood.
02gzHnpz1W4_17-8-rgb_front	8.96	Now I'll have to work it just a little bit, because there you go, pull.
02gzHnpz1W4_18-8-rgb_front	7.21	My square piece of wood is going to create problems, but if this was a round piece like a broomstick or something, this would actually tighten up a lot tighter.
02gzHnpz1W4_19-8-rgb_front	2.92	Now as you can see here, this is how your figure of eight loop should look.
02gzHnpz1W4_2-8-rgb_front	2.79	It?s used to tie around something, you know if you want to.
02gzHnpz1W4_20-8-rgb_front	5.21	Kind of weaving around, you know, weaving around through and of itself.
02gzHnpz1W4_21-8-rgb_front	2.96	Create this nice constrictor type knot.
02gzHnpz1W4_3-8-rgb_front	3.46	It?s kind of like a decorative or an ornamental knot.
02gzHnpz1W4_4-8-rgb_front	3.71	So if you look down here, you can see I've got my line that I'm going to use.
02gzHnpz1W4_5-8-rgb_front	4.25	And what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull a little bit more out, because I'm going to need a lot of it.
02gzHnpz1W4_6-8-rgb_front	1.42	This is going to be my working end over here.
02gzHnpz1W4_7-8-rgb_front	4.5	I'm just going to loop, just a nice overhand loop over here on my working end.
02gzHnpz1W4_8-8-rgb_front	7.67	I'm going to bring over here and I'm going to create an underhand loop, not like that, but like that.
02gzHnpz1W4_9-8-rgb_front	4.71	So that they are kind of making this nice figure of eight as it comes around.
02yXvi1VmPI_0-8-rgb_front	0.42	Hello!
02yXvi1VmPI_10-8-rgb_front	4.25	But if they've been painted in the last 3 or 4 years you probably just can use an electric one.
02yXvi1VmPI_11-8-rgb_front	9.96	Once you've got that pressure washed, then you want to go ahead and dust that all down, do your caulking, do your spackling, and do all of your sanding.
02yXvi1VmPI_12-8-rgb_front	4.33	Then once you've got that basic crepe work done, then you're going to be ready to start priming.
02yXvi1VmPI_13-8-rgb_front	6.79	Once we have all of that preparation done, we'll talk a little bit about the types of paints we're going to want to choose and how to pour that paint up.
02yXvi1VmPI_14-8-rgb_front	6.33	Once we've gone over that, then we're going to actually show how to apply this paint both on the interior eaves and the fascia.
02yXvi1VmPI_15-8-rgb_front	9.75	Then when we're done we'll talk a little bit how to clean everything up and how to maintain this work throughout the year to have a long lasting paint job that will really beautify your house.
02yXvi1VmPI_16-8-rgb_front	6.75	So when you get done with this series today you're going to know everything you need to know for painting the exterior eaves on your house.
02yXvi1VmPI_2-8-rgb_front	5.04	Now we'd like to talk in this series about painting the exterior eaves on your house.
02yXvi1VmPI_3-8-rgb_front	4.21	Now whenever you're painting exterior eaves, a couple things you want to look at.
02yXvi1VmPI_4-8-rgb_front	6.83	First of all, make sure you wear a hat to kind of keep the sun off of your head and your face and some kind of sunglass.
02yXvi1VmPI_5-8-rgb_front	2.25	Now, the sunglasses do 2 things.
02yXvi1VmPI_6-8-rgb_front	10.46	They're going to protect any chips or paint from falling in your eyes and they're going to keep that glare out of your face because usually you're painting some kind of white or pastel because of the heavy, heavy reflection.
02yXvi1VmPI_7-8-rgb_front	3.96	Now, when you're painting the eaves of your house a few things you need to consider.
02yXvi1VmPI_8-8-rgb_front	2.12	First of all, how bad do they look.
02yXvi1VmPI_9-8-rgb_front	6.33	If they're peeling really, really bad then you're going to want to get a really strong pressure washer on that like a gas powered one.
032PDxai5GE_1-8-rgb_front	2.71	It's very important that you hold your weapon correctly.
032PDxai5GE_10-8-rgb_front	5.42	Otherwise, to hold it includes holding it deep in the hand a little lower depending on what your goals are.
032PDxai5GE_11-8-rgb_front	0.83	Again, watch carefully.
032PDxai5GE_12-8-rgb_front	7.04	I'm holding it in the fingers, basic position, and depending on what I do, it changes its position in my hand, and that's key.
032PDxai5GE_13-8-rgb_front	1.54	It is not locked into place.
032PDxai5GE_14-8-rgb_front	2.29	The fingers manipulate the weapon.
032PDxai5GE_15-8-rgb_front	1.33	I can make thrusts.
032PDxai5GE_16-8-rgb_front	0.79	I can make cuts.
032PDxai5GE_17-8-rgb_front	1.12	I can make parries like so.
032PDxai5GE_2-8-rgb_front	1.92	There are multiple ways to hold your sabre correctly.
032PDxai5GE_3-8-rgb_front	7.42	The very basic way, we start with the thumb opposite of curl on the guard about half an inch or so.
032PDxai5GE_4-8-rgb_front	6.33	The index finger, opposite the thumb, the other fingers curl around, like so, I'll show you without the glove on.
032PDxai5GE_5-8-rgb_front	1.04	Hold it right on the fingers.
032PDxai5GE_6-8-rgb_front	3.54	Notice that my hands aren't split open like so just here.
032PDxai5GE_7-8-rgb_front	1.38	This allows me to make cuts.
032PDxai5GE_8-8-rgb_front	1.0	I can make thrusts.
032PDxai5GE_9-8-rgb_front	3.38	I can change the position of the weapon in my hand depending on what I'm doing.
034pv2RSK8E_0-8-rgb_front	4.79	Hamstring curls in a quad prone position.
034pv2RSK8E_1-8-rgb_front	3.29	We're going to put the weight behind our knee.
034pv2RSK8E_10-8-rgb_front	4.12	Leave the ankle, the foot, nice and soft, don't excessively point or flex.
034pv2RSK8E_11-8-rgb_front	2.67	It's not going to put any more workload in there.
034pv2RSK8E_12-8-rgb_front	4.08	You've already got resistance to the movement, you've got position of the movement.
034pv2RSK8E_13-8-rgb_front	5.04	Nice slow and controlled, up two, down two.
034pv2RSK8E_14-8-rgb_front	5.54	Working within ten to fifteen reps, three sets.
034pv2RSK8E_2-8-rgb_front	4.46	Make sure you've got a weight that you're going to be able to control and keep in there.
034pv2RSK8E_3-8-rgb_front	10.17	Some people like the, you can get balls, medicine balls, little weighted balls to put in there as well, but this will work just fine with our hands underneath our shoulders.
034pv2RSK8E_4-8-rgb_front	2.67	Knees square with the hips.
034pv2RSK8E_5-8-rgb_front	4.88	And we're going to contract exhale and inhale release.
034pv2RSK8E_6-8-rgb_front	4.79	It is not necessary to come all the way back down, because then I lose neutral posture.
034pv2RSK8E_7-8-rgb_front	3.92	You want to maintain neutral posture, this is kind of a half plank.
034pv2RSK8E_8-8-rgb_front	8.08	So we exhale, we contract, we don't want to go any higher than the hip, after that we're involving the low back and the exercise is over.
034pv2RSK8E_9-8-rgb_front	3.38	Primary focus remember is hamstring, passes into the glut.
03513v6_5TU_0-8-rgb_front	6.04	Choosing a saddle can be not only a difficult decision, but one that requires a lot of time and patience in shopping.
03513v6_5TU_1-8-rgb_front	4.21	It helps if we start out understanding what we're buying and what we might expect to pay.
03513v6_5TU_10-8-rgb_front	6.29	We move on up to a nice barrel saddle of a name brand, that's going to be better probably upwards of eight hundred dollars.
03513v6_5TU_11-8-rgb_front	5.42	This saddle in its original show condition could bring it up to near a thousand.
03513v6_5TU_12-8-rgb_front	11.08	As we move on forward, some of these more showy saddles as well as a really good functional cutting saddle, you can go with name brands that will take you as high as three thousand and upward, I've seen them as high as six thousand.
03513v6_5TU_13-8-rgb_front	5.88	So you can see you've got a wide variety of choices, and you're going to have to decide within your budget what's your best option.
03513v6_5TU_2-8-rgb_front	4.71	I usually coach my clients in trying to find the very best used saddle possible.
03513v6_5TU_3-8-rgb_front	4.08	If they are in fact in a bit of a budgeted plan.
03513v6_5TU_4-8-rgb_front	5.21	If we buy a brand new saddle, one we have to break it in, and sometimes it's fun to have that happen before we get it.
03513v6_5TU_5-8-rgb_front	6.88	But it's also going to be very pricey, and it may become even more pricey as we look at the time that we have to spend shopping.
03513v6_5TU_6-8-rgb_front	6.5	We want to start out with thinking about a synthetic saddle, although not my very favorite, it does fall in the more budgeted category.
03513v6_5TU_7-8-rgb_front	3.96	We'll talk about the merits of the synthetic versus leather down the road.
03513v6_5TU_8-8-rgb_front	4.71	But these saddles can be found even brand new for as low as two hundred fifty to three hundred dollars.
03513v6_5TU_9-8-rgb_front	6.62	As I move into my youth saddles, a brand new saddle of this type might be about three hundred and fifty dollars to four hundred dollars.
038vE9JsU9I_0-8-rgb_front	4.71	Here is some tools and supplies that you need to maintain your saxophone.
038vE9JsU9I_1-8-rgb_front	3.79	First off I'm going to start off with a little baby powder.
038vE9JsU9I_2-8-rgb_front	3.54	We'll use a dollar bill in conjunction with the baby powder.
038vE9JsU9I_3-8-rgb_front	11.54	We've got a little bit of soap here, some contact cement as you can get at any hardware store, key oil, we also have some thread locker.
038vE9JsU9I_4-8-rgb_front	3.29	I like the blue because it is removable.
038vE9JsU9I_5-8-rgb_front	19.71	We have cork grease here, which is a necessity, we have a little cleaning brush, a regular old paintbrush, a small flathead screwdriver, a large flathead screwdriver or a Phillips head screwdriver you might need depending on what brand of saxophone you have.
038vE9JsU9I_6-8-rgb_front	15.71	Some duck-billed pliers, some four ought steel wool, some round nosed pliers, a cleaning snake as well as a lacquer cloth.
038vE9JsU9I_7-8-rgb_front	2.04	And those are the tools and supplies needed for saxophone maintenance.
03EzcoSP2pc_0-8-rgb_front	2.96	In this clip, we're going to talk about penalty kicks.
03EzcoSP2pc_1-8-rgb_front	2.96	In indoor soccer, there are two types of penalty kicks.
03EzcoSP2pc_10-8-rgb_front	6.46	The ball is placed at the penalty kick dot that is on the field, a little bit in front of the penalty box.
03EzcoSP2pc_11-8-rgb_front	11.62	At that point, the keeper must stay on the goal line, the official will blow his whistle, and once the ball is touched, the keeper is allowed to move from the line, to save the ball.
03EzcoSP2pc_12-8-rgb_front	6.04	It's a very short shot, so usually it's taken with some sort of accuracy or power.
03EzcoSP2pc_13-8-rgb_front	11.12	Once the ball is kicked, if the ball hits the wall, but does not touch another person, then the person kicking the penalty kick is not allowed to touch the ball, it must touch someone else before hand.
03EzcoSP2pc_14-8-rgb_front	6.79	If it does go off the keeper, then the player is allowed to then try to get the rebound into the goal.
03EzcoSP2pc_15-8-rgb_front	6.75	But once it's touched, or once the ball is kicked towards the goal, everybody else is allowed to enter the play of field.
03EzcoSP2pc_2-8-rgb_front	2.25	What I'm going to tell you about is the run up pad.
03EzcoSP2pc_3-8-rgb_front	5.04	Now basically this is very different than the outdoor version of a PK.
03EzcoSP2pc_4-8-rgb_front	9.04	This is when a flagrant foul, usually a blue card style foul, is committed, and there was possibly an offensive chance for a goal.
03EzcoSP2pc_5-8-rgb_front	22.62	So the referee will pull all the players back behind the red line, and the person who gets awarded the kick, gets the ball started at the red line, and the goal keeper has to start with his heels on the goal line, and once the referee blows his whistle, those two can come out, and then it's basically one V one.
03EzcoSP2pc_6-8-rgb_front	10.92	When the shot is taken, if it's missed the play is dead, and I believe the team that was awarded the kick automatically gets a free kick after the PK.
03EzcoSP2pc_7-8-rgb_front	6.42	The other PK is just one of your standard penalty kicks where everybody is placed outside the red line.
03EzcoSP2pc_8-8-rgb_front	5.5	You get one of these kicks when a penalty or a foul occurs inside the goalie box.
03EzcoSP2pc_9-8-rgb_front	5.46	Again it's a smaller goalie box, so these are a little bit rarer than the one V one penalty kicks.
03SgrpiJkSw_0-8-rgb_front	0.21	O.K.
03SgrpiJkSw_1-8-rgb_front	1.83	we have our gloves on.
03SgrpiJkSw_10-8-rgb_front	7.12	We are not doing this randomly, this is very clear and very precise about which pores we are cleaning out.
03SgrpiJkSw_11-8-rgb_front	1.46	So we'll go ahead and get started.
03SgrpiJkSw_12-8-rgb_front	7.33	Everything is moving nicely.
03SgrpiJkSw_13-8-rgb_front	14.62	The thing about an acne facial, is you never want to force anything from the skin.
03SgrpiJkSw_14-8-rgb_front	5.33	You want it all to come easily because the less irritated that the skin is the better.
03SgrpiJkSw_2-8-rgb_front	2.54	And we are going to cover the eyes again.
03SgrpiJkSw_3-8-rgb_front	1.08	A little bit more water.
03SgrpiJkSw_4-8-rgb_front	2.62	You want to cover the eyes for the protection of the light.
03SgrpiJkSw_5-8-rgb_front	5.88	So there we are, stay away, turn the light, bright light.
03SgrpiJkSw_6-8-rgb_front	0.92	Grab some tissue.
03SgrpiJkSw_7-8-rgb_front	6.42	And you want to use tissue just a little more protection so that you are not irritating the skin as much.
03SgrpiJkSw_8-8-rgb_front	1.62	Move the light over.
03SgrpiJkSw_9-8-rgb_front	8.96	This is 350 Diopter Scope, so the magnifying glass is really gonna help us get into every single pore.
03VktV6bl7c_0-8-rgb_front	4.25	Alright, the last thing you want to take a look at is context.
03VktV6bl7c_1-8-rgb_front	6.46	And when I'm talking about context, I'm talking about the actual space that you are going to speak in.
03VktV6bl7c_2-8-rgb_front	2.0	First of all, how big is your audience?
03VktV6bl7c_3-8-rgb_front	2.04	Are you going to be speaking to twenty people?
03VktV6bl7c_4-8-rgb_front	2.21	Are you going to be speaking to five hundred people?
03VktV6bl7c_5-8-rgb_front	10.08	The topic that you choose and the level of intimacy in which you present it, will vary dramatically, for twelve or twenty people versus five hundred people.
03VktV6bl7c_6-8-rgb_front	5.42	You also need to take a look at the time of day that you're giving your speech.
03VktV6bl7c_7-8-rgb_front	8.5	If you're doing the speech right before lunch, you might not want to do a speech about delicious food.
03VktV6bl7c_8-8-rgb_front	6.75	Because your audience might not be able to concentrate because they're so hungry that they want to go get some delicious food.
03VktV6bl7c_9-8-rgb_front	11.25	Or, you might not want to do something that might be boring to them because they're so hungry, they've got that internal noise going on and they're not listening to anything you say, because they are hungry.
03WUE9zzQY4_0-8-rgb_front	1.96	Alright, now that you're good and inspired.
03WUE9zzQY4_1-8-rgb_front	2.29	Ready to get designing, itching to draw.
03WUE9zzQY4_10-8-rgb_front	1.42	This is one of mine from awhile back.
03WUE9zzQY4_11-8-rgb_front	1.5	This is my design.
03WUE9zzQY4_12-8-rgb_front	1.54	This is the basic figure.
03WUE9zzQY4_13-8-rgb_front	2.96	It's a skinny stretched out version of a human.
03WUE9zzQY4_14-8-rgb_front	14.21	It's very important before you start designing any collection and every collection to have a stable of these croquis where you can just have them in a sketch pad and then you can just draw and sketch little designs on each one.
03WUE9zzQY4_15-8-rgb_front	5.58	You don't want to have to spend your whole time doing the figuring getting it right which is why we're going to work on that right now.
03WUE9zzQY4_16-8-rgb_front	4.88	And I'll show you how to have a perfect figure in which to design your designs upon.
03WUE9zzQY4_2-8-rgb_front	1.88	You got ideas circling in your head.
03WUE9zzQY4_3-8-rgb_front	5.38	The first thing you need to do is have a Croquis, which is the basic figure to design upon.
03WUE9zzQY4_4-8-rgb_front	2.96	It comes from the French word to sketch.
03WUE9zzQY4_5-8-rgb_front	1.46	So I'm sure you've probably never heard it.
03WUE9zzQY4_6-8-rgb_front	2.08	If you have, more power to you 'cause I hadn't.
03WUE9zzQY4_7-8-rgb_front	0.92	This is the word.
03WUE9zzQY4_8-8-rgb_front	0.46	Visual.
03WUE9zzQY4_9-8-rgb_front	5.67	And the basic figure when it's finished without color is going to look like this.
03jABW2MKkk_0-8-rgb_front	4.88	Hi, I'm Jay French at jayfrenchstudios.com, and I'm going to show you how to draw clasped hands.
03jABW2MKkk_1-8-rgb_front	12.42	Okay, to draw clasped hands, of course there are many angles you can do this from, we're going to do it from pretty much the forward angle like this, so, what you have is, I'm going to draw the back of the hands.
03jABW2MKkk_10-8-rgb_front	8.0	And that's how to do the clasped hand from that angle until you see just the hint of the pinkie finger there.
03jABW2MKkk_11-8-rgb_front	5.5	Then show your knuckle line, from there you can add shading.
03jABW2MKkk_12-8-rgb_front	0.67	Fingernails.
03jABW2MKkk_13-8-rgb_front	6.33	And, you have the front view of clasped hands.
03jABW2MKkk_14-8-rgb_front	2.12	And that is one way to draw clasped hands.
03jABW2MKkk_15-8-rgb_front	2.42	Remember to look for photo sources as your best bet.
03jABW2MKkk_2-8-rgb_front	12.88	We have your basic wedge of a hand, give the impression of that, but, and I've done them too far apart, so, we want them clasped tight so let's do this.
03jABW2MKkk_3-8-rgb_front	5.17	Start with your thumbs and draw the thumb that's going to go over the top first.
03jABW2MKkk_4-8-rgb_front	7.88	And one underneath second, and from here you would think you would just be drawing something like this.
03jABW2MKkk_5-8-rgb_front	8.71	But it doesn't work that way because they overlap, so draw your top finger again, and it's going to be the same hand, if you clasp your own fingers you'll notice this.
03jABW2MKkk_6-8-rgb_front	2.58	It's going to be the same hand that has the thumb on top.
03jABW2MKkk_7-8-rgb_front	1.29	It's your top finger in there.
03jABW2MKkk_8-8-rgb_front	8.62	Now you have a smaller, because it's half covered by the other hand, ring finger, or index finger from that hand.
03jABW2MKkk_9-8-rgb_front	3.0	And the same thing is happening here, it's half covered until it comes out here.
03lzv6OzJhE_1-8-rgb_front	4.17	Yep we are going to deep fry this and we are going to have a breading on it that is just going to taste great.
03lzv6OzJhE_10-8-rgb_front	9.71	Here we go alright so we would finish this up, up here.
03lzv6OzJhE_11-8-rgb_front	9.25	I will these into the deep fryer and see how long it take to get them fry.
03lzv6OzJhE_12-8-rgb_front	1.04	Clean off my fingers.
03lzv6OzJhE_13-8-rgb_front	4.96	Okay we are goign to put these into the basket here.
03lzv6OzJhE_14-8-rgb_front	4.42	Next segment we are going to do we are going to do something very interesting we are going to do some oysters.
03lzv6OzJhE_15-8-rgb_front	7.92	So when we come with this we see how many minutes it took to cook it and when it is golden brown it is done and then we would start on the oysters for you.
03lzv6OzJhE_16-8-rgb_front	14.25	Okay I think these are ready now they have been in here for 4 1/2 minutes we had the temperature up about 375 and it depends on your taste if you like them a little bit darker then you could leave them a little longer but really watch them.
03lzv6OzJhE_17-8-rgb_front	4.29	Cause once they start to get really brown they go fast.
03lzv6OzJhE_18-8-rgb_front	6.42	Alright here you go simple, easy, delicious, deep fried calamari.
03lzv6OzJhE_19-8-rgb_front	3.21	Find your you special sauce and go dipping go eat it.
03lzv6OzJhE_20-8-rgb_front	4.5	The next thing you see from us the next segment would be oysters deep fried in breading.
03lzv6OzJhE_2_3-8-rgb_front	8.92	I will show you how to do it. First off this is calamari that has been cut we had it cut first and we are going to go ahead and use these.
03lzv6OzJhE_4-8-rgb_front	5.08	I didn't drain them very well, I'm going to get a paper towel and get them a little dryer in there.
03lzv6OzJhE_5-8-rgb_front	10.08	So our breading has salt, pepper, a little bit of garlic, and then we put a little bit of Italian seasoning so it gives it that extra kick.
03lzv6OzJhE_6-8-rgb_front	6.75	You could put anything you want into it it could be something hot and spicy it is jsut whatever your taste is.
03lzv6OzJhE_7-8-rgb_front	8.96	Okay so we are just going to throw some in here and I'm going to do this by hand instead of trying to use the utensils my kitchen, my food, my fingers.
03lzv6OzJhE_8-8-rgb_front	13.67	So I'm going to put that like that this is flour and I threw a little bit of the pepper and salt in there and this is our breading this is a great dry batter it is just bread crumbs and breading that has just been made especially for this type of thing.
03lzv6OzJhE_9-8-rgb_front	10.75	We are going to put it right there and then we are going ot do this one and this is just eggs this is just eggs right there just beat up to make it sticky.
03pzaOT7rPM_0-8-rgb_front	7.71	To continuing with the energy of Virabhadrasana II or Hero Pose, when you inhale lift up through the crown.
03pzaOT7rPM_1-8-rgb_front	5.0	You might imagine that your best friend's palm is right on the crown of your head and you're just lifting up to touch.
03pzaOT7rPM_2-8-rgb_front	6.0	That's going to accentuate a lengthening of the whole spine but particularly in the cervical spine in the neck.
03pzaOT7rPM_3-8-rgb_front	6.83	So everytime you inhale think about lifting up through the crown of the head and then as you exhale, stretch the arms more.
03pzaOT7rPM_4-8-rgb_front	3.92	Reach those arms out, remember to keep them on the same plane.
03pzaOT7rPM_5-8-rgb_front	5.96	And once again, turning the chin along the horizon to look out over your longest right fingertip.
03pzaOT7rPM_6-8-rgb_front	5.92	Inhaling lengthening, exhaling sitting down a little bit more and stretching out through the fingertips.
03pzaOT7rPM_7-8-rgb_front	5.17	Stretching in all directions and breathing.
03pzaOT7rPM_8-8-rgb_front	9.17	You can always check that back hand before you come over to check the forward hand to make sure that they are on the same plane.
03w0fj9vLpo_1-8-rgb_front	2.58	Today we are going to make a polymer clay bowl.
03w0fj9vLpo_10-8-rgb_front	5.75	You are going to mold them down or pull some out but you are going to try to make it so that it√¢¬Ä¬ôs even.
03w0fj9vLpo_11-8-rgb_front	11.21	What we are making is a flower shaped cane and in order to do that we need to have a nice flower center and it looks really pretty if the center is a swirl.
03w0fj9vLpo_12-8-rgb_front	14.71	So now what we are going to do, we are going to maybe take a rolling pin, do an extra little roll, we are going to roll this lengthwise.
03w0fj9vLpo_13-8-rgb_front	3.25	You want to make sure you have that first on in pretty tight.
03w0fj9vLpo_14-8-rgb_front	6.46	Then you can bring it in a little and roll it but you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to press too hard.
03w0fj9vLpo_15-8-rgb_front	7.25	You want to make sure that its a nice even log but you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to smush it too much, or stretch it too much because we are trying to keep that swirl shape that we made.
03w0fj9vLpo_2-8-rgb_front	6.12	In this next step we are going to create the canes to decorate our polymer bowl.
03w0fj9vLpo_3-8-rgb_front	4.67	So what we are going to do, we are going to take two contrasting colors.
03w0fj9vLpo_4-8-rgb_front	1.79	I am going to use black and white.
03w0fj9vLpo_5-8-rgb_front	2.67	There is nothing more contrasting than that.
03w0fj9vLpo_6-8-rgb_front	20.46	And we are going to roll our black, soften it up and then we are going to roll our white, soften it up.
03w0fj9vLpo_7-8-rgb_front	10.38	We are going to roll our white piece and then we are going to do the same thing to our black piece.
03w0fj9vLpo_8-8-rgb_front	6.79	So basically we are going to get two flat pieces of contrasting color and it doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt have to be perfectly shaped.
03w0fj9vLpo_9-8-rgb_front	6.96	And you are going to place one on top of the other and then you are going to try to remove any edges.
03xD5BhCG94_0-8-rgb_front	11.5	In doing side lying leg work, you want to make sure that your entire body is stacked so that the hips are stacked one on the top of each other and you are not curled back or rolling forward.
03xD5BhCG94_1-8-rgb_front	1.21	The legs are stacked.
03xD5BhCG94_10-8-rgb_front	1.67	Point down, we are working the back.
03xD5BhCG94_11-8-rgb_front	3.96	So, we are going to take a nice inhale and float the leg up.
03xD5BhCG94_12-8-rgb_front	0.58	Exhale.
03xD5BhCG94_13-8-rgb_front	1.62	We are going to flex the foot.
03xD5BhCG94_14-8-rgb_front	4.88	Pull the band and squeeze that inner thigh to bring the leg down.
03xD5BhCG94_15-8-rgb_front	1.12	Point the toe down.
03xD5BhCG94_16-8-rgb_front	0.83	Inhale.
03xD5BhCG94_17-8-rgb_front	0.29	Up.
03xD5BhCG94_18-8-rgb_front	0.83	Exhale.
03xD5BhCG94_19-8-rgb_front	2.04	Flex and squeeze down.
03xD5BhCG94_2-8-rgb_front	1.38	The abs are pulled in.
03xD5BhCG94_20-8-rgb_front	0.58	Point.
03xD5BhCG94_21-8-rgb_front	0.46	Down.
03xD5BhCG94_22-8-rgb_front	1.04	Inhale.
03xD5BhCG94_23-8-rgb_front	0.21	Up.
03xD5BhCG94_24-8-rgb_front	1.12	Exhale.
03xD5BhCG94_25-8-rgb_front	2.58	Flex and squeeze down.
03xD5BhCG94_3-8-rgb_front	1.67	The ribcage is pulled in.
03xD5BhCG94_4-8-rgb_front	7.54	And, you make a little pillow for your head with your elbow bent, so that the head is fairly in line with the spine.
03xD5BhCG94_5-8-rgb_front	7.71	Whenever you are doing legwork and you find yourself rolling to one side or the other, try and straighten yourself out by engaging your abs.
03xD5BhCG94_6-8-rgb_front	5.25	So, in this exercise, we have the band around our foot covering the toes.
03xD5BhCG94_7-8-rgb_front	2.75	We are going to point the toe down.
03xD5BhCG94_8-8-rgb_front	5.58	And, the reason we do that is that we want to work the back of the leg as opposed to the quadriceps.
03xD5BhCG94_9-8-rgb_front	2.5	If we point up, we will be working this muscle.
04-j8JucIXg_0-8-rgb_front	4.12	Hi, this is John Stewart, and this is how to raise the tent when setting up your tent.
04-j8JucIXg_1-8-rgb_front	4.08	Once you've got your poles inserted into the tent, you can then raise up your tent.
04-j8JucIXg_10-8-rgb_front	4.75	Yes, it can get frustrating, but just take your time, and it'll go up nice and smoothly.
04-j8JucIXg_11-8-rgb_front	3.29	And if you do have that friend, grab him and they can help you out.
04-j8JucIXg_12-8-rgb_front	1.46	And this is how to raise the tent.
04-j8JucIXg_2-8-rgb_front	9.21	Once you've got the poles crisscrossed at the center, most of the time, they're tied together to where they're standing and you don't have to hold them any longer, you can then go into raising the tent.
04-j8JucIXg_3-8-rgb_front	7.88	The tent's going to have two things to put it through, you can either have the poles that have sleeves that Velcro over the pole, or you'll have clips.
04-j8JucIXg_4-8-rgb_front	2.5	Both of them are very fast and efficient to set up.
04-j8JucIXg_5-8-rgb_front	1.96	The clips seem to be a little bit sturdier.
04-j8JucIXg_6-8-rgb_front	4.21	You just go along the pole and clip them one by one until you get them all clipped.
04-j8JucIXg_7-8-rgb_front	2.75	Once you've got them clipped, the tent should be stood upright.
04-j8JucIXg_8-8-rgb_front	2.04	And then you can go into staking out your tent.
04-j8JucIXg_9-8-rgb_front	4.08	One thing to remember is that setting up a tent, you can do this with one person.
04DtdCu2kfg_0-5-rgb_front	1.58	Hi, this is Sean Hobson.
04DtdCu2kfg_1-5-rgb_front	3.09	Right now we're talking about the man-to-man defense.
04DtdCu2kfg_10-5-rgb_front	2.59	"What if my guy is still standing out there?"""
04DtdCu2kfg_11-5-rgb_front	5.96	Well right now, he's the farthest person away to getting the ball, we're not really concerned about that.
04DtdCu2kfg_12-5-rgb_front	13.1	So what we want this defender to do, is to drop all the way, in fact we want him underneath the basket, splitting, his body should be splitting the middle of the floor, even over a little bit.
04DtdCu2kfg_13-5-rgb_front	15.72	Because what's going to happen is, if this guy beats his man on the drive, the only person back to help is this guy right here on defense and he's going to have to come out and try to either take a charge or stop this guy's drive.
04DtdCu2kfg_14-5-rgb_front	3.34	"Now, you say, ""But what about my man on the other side?"""
04DtdCu2kfg_15-5-rgb_front	10.47	Well, sometimes you get beat on that with the simple fact that if he has to close up here on the drive and his man comes in, then this guy could dish off.
04DtdCu2kfg_16-5-rgb_front	6.3	You've just got to be a good enough defender that you could come out and play defense here and get back on here.
04DtdCu2kfg_17-5-rgb_front	9.01	But the main thing is, we want to be in help side deep here and even if this guy skips the ball back, you're going to be able to recover.
04DtdCu2kfg_18-5-rgb_front	5.63	So make sure when the ball is opposite your man that you get all the way into the half court.
04DtdCu2kfg_19-5-rgb_front	8.17	You see how he's dropped low enough too that he could see ball and his man when he's looking up the court.
04DtdCu2kfg_2-5-rgb_front	6.13	We're talking about the positioning of our defensive man as the ball moves around the perimeter.
04DtdCu2kfg_20-5-rgb_front	5.59	That's very very important to know where the ball and your man is in the man-to-man defense.
04DtdCu2kfg_3-5-rgb_front	4.42	Obviously, when they have the ball, we're on the ball with our defense.
04DtdCu2kfg_4-5-rgb_front	5.34	Then as the ball moves one pass away, we changed into deny defense.
04DtdCu2kfg_5-5-rgb_front	4.59	"Then as the ball moved to the top, we talked about being in ""help side""."
04DtdCu2kfg_6-5-rgb_front	5.21	The main thing is, we want this guy to pointing to the ball and his man.
04DtdCu2kfg_7-5-rgb_front	4.42	What we want to talk about now is a little bit different style of help side.
04DtdCu2kfg_8-5-rgb_front	8.51	That's when the ball actually swings all the way to the opposite side away from the side of your man.
04DtdCu2kfg_9-5-rgb_front	4.25	"A lot of people are concerned, ""What happens to my guy?"
04VKILduLSM_0-8-rgb_front	2.5	If you want to go to Vegas and make some money at the crap table.
04VKILduLSM_1-8-rgb_front	3.12	My name is Dean Hale and I'm going to teach you how to win at craps.
04VKILduLSM_10-8-rgb_front	2.5	So that's going to give you a better chance to hedge your bet.
04VKILduLSM_11-8-rgb_front	4.12	What you are going to want to do is eventually have money on three different numbers.
04VKILduLSM_12-8-rgb_front	3.71	This takes down the casino advantage to it's lowest point.
04VKILduLSM_13-8-rgb_front	5.04	That's the easiest way to try to win some money at craps, is to minimize the casino's advantage.
04VKILduLSM_14-8-rgb_front	10.46	So pass line, if they don't hit their seven eleven initially, try to get it on the come out line, your money on two different numbers so you can minimize the casino's advantage.
04VKILduLSM_15-8-rgb_front	4.33	My name is Dean Hale and I've just given you the best advice you can get about winning at craps.
04VKILduLSM_2-8-rgb_front	5.38	Craps is a game where if you roll as the shooter comes out and shoots and he rolls a seven or eleven you win.
04VKILduLSM_3-8-rgb_front	1.79	But there's also other ways to win at craps.
04VKILduLSM_4-8-rgb_front	6.42	There's a pass line, and if you put the money on the pass line and the shooter rolls a seven or an eleven, you win automatically.
04VKILduLSM_5-8-rgb_front	2.88	Unfortunately if they roll two, three or twelve you lose.
04VKILduLSM_6-8-rgb_front	7.29	Now what you are going to want to do is the safest way to hedge your bet in craps is to try to have your money on three different numbers.
04VKILduLSM_7-8-rgb_front	4.71	So what you are going to do is you are going to put money down on the pass line, and if they roll a seven or eleven great you win.
04VKILduLSM_8-8-rgb_front	1.5	Take the money off and you can bet again.
04VKILduLSM_9-8-rgb_front	7.25	If they don't and they hit their point or say they roll an eight and that's their point, you want to put some money on the come out line.
04hnjLKHh2g_0-5-rgb_front	3.29	Now I'll show you how to use a pastry bag.
04hnjLKHh2g_1-5-rgb_front	16.04	First you want to hold the pastry bag in your hand like this, and with your thumb and your finger, gather up the excess bag on the top.
04hnjLKHh2g_10-5-rgb_front	6.96	We're just going to use a star tip and make little stars for our border.
04hnjLKHh2g_11-5-rgb_front	9.33	And how you do that is you squeeze, holding the tip just slightly above the cake.
04hnjLKHh2g_12-5-rgb_front	5.42	You're not touching the cake, you're not pushing the tip into the cake.
04hnjLKHh2g_13-5-rgb_front	8.92	You're holding it just a tiny bit above, maybe an eighth of an inch above the cake, and squeezing.
04hnjLKHh2g_14-5-rgb_front	9.67	And then before you lift the tip away, you want to release pressure.
04hnjLKHh2g_15-5-rgb_front	6.5	Now if you continue with pressure while you're lifting, you're going to end up with a big tip.
04hnjLKHh2g_16-5-rgb_front	4.46	Okay, let me show you that again nice and close up.
04hnjLKHh2g_17-5-rgb_front	2.54	First I'm going to clean off the tip there.
04hnjLKHh2g_18-5-rgb_front	6.75	Now you hold the tip about an eighth of an inch over the surface.
04hnjLKHh2g_19-5-rgb_front	4.04	And you squeeze, until you get a little star.
04hnjLKHh2g_2-5-rgb_front	6.17	The fullness of the bag is going to sit in the palm of your hand like that.
04hnjLKHh2g_20-5-rgb_front	6.38	And you release the pressure of your hand and lift up at the same time.
04hnjLKHh2g_21-5-rgb_front	2.92	Now here's what you don't do.
04hnjLKHh2g_22-5-rgb_front	4.71	I'm squeezing, squeezing, squeezing and then I'm lifting.
04hnjLKHh2g_23-5-rgb_front	5.0	And I end up with a big tip here that we don't want.
04hnjLKHh2g_24-5-rgb_front	7.46	You want to hold it, squeeze, release pressure, and pull up.
04hnjLKHh2g_25-5-rgb_front	2.46	And then you get a nice star.
04hnjLKHh2g_3-5-rgb_front	13.29	Now you can twist the bag while pinching that top, pinching the twist, with your thumb and your finger, in your hand like that.
04hnjLKHh2g_4-5-rgb_front	6.0	And that causes a pressure in the bag.
04hnjLKHh2g_5-5-rgb_front	9.17	You can feel that it gets full and tight, and you really want to hold on tightly with your thumb and finger like that.
04hnjLKHh2g_6-5-rgb_front	11.83	Now you'll use your fingers - the other four fingers - and your palm to squeeze the bag.
04hnjLKHh2g_7-5-rgb_front	15.29	And as it squeezes the frosting out, you'll have to continue to turn and twist the bag while holding on tightly with your thumb and the edge of your hand right here.
04hnjLKHh2g_8-5-rgb_front	13.92	You can see here how as I twist it I'm holding tightly here, and when I squeeze, the frosting will come out.
04hnjLKHh2g_9-5-rgb_front	3.5	And I'm squeezing with my fingers and my palm.
05LWN7tIdEo_0-5-rgb_front	19.96	If I hit a shot, and I have this right hand, so I hit a shot, I'm already slower, if I've got my left hand I can turn and be going or I can grab across like this.
05LWN7tIdEo_1-5-rgb_front	25.58	So, while this hand is free, I'm moving
05LWN7tIdEo_2-5-rgb_front	3.79	Now, much better position right here.
05LWN7tIdEo_3-5-rgb_front	9.67	And those are little things that you just have to learn over the years, unless somebody watches you and says get your butt out of this part of the court, you know.
05LWN7tIdEo_4-5-rgb_front	15.75	But, I'm not a pro tennis player, these are just little things I know in my head
05LWN7tIdEo_5-5-rgb_front	1.75	It's different, it's a whole different world.
05LWN7tIdEo_6-5-rgb_front	7.71	Now, your strokes would be better than mine, even right now, but you'd be all fouled up with the, with the wheel chair.
05LWN7tIdEo_7-5-rgb_front	6.96	But, a good player, that has the strokes, once they get the wheel chair down, you're in trouble.
05gjcxakphc_1-5-rgb_front	6.71	For starters, you have to know how to pair your shoes with the right outfit.
05gjcxakphc_10-5-rgb_front	12.62	You can wear them over jeans, under jeans, or here you can pair them with leggings and they have a slenderizing affect.
05gjcxakphc_11-5-rgb_front	5.67	Join us in the next segment and we're going to be talking about how to accessorize with a belt.
05gjcxakphc_2-5-rgb_front	15.04	If you're wearing a dress, such as a short dress, you can wear large, clunky shoes that may or may not match your outfit.
05gjcxakphc_3-5-rgb_front	8.58	One of my favorite things to do is to wear large wedge shoes with a short, cute cocktail dress.
05gjcxakphc_4-5-rgb_front	9.71	Also what you can do is this: today I'm wearing a pair of jeans that I paired up with some heels.
05gjcxakphc_5-5-rgb_front	7.21	If you take a look at these shoes... which I actually got from a fashion sale, directly from the designer.
05gjcxakphc_6-5-rgb_front	3.08	They're kind of fun.
05gjcxakphc_7-5-rgb_front	8.0	They may not go with every outfit but I have a pretty plain top and jeans on.
05gjcxakphc_8-5-rgb_front	20.33	And since they are heels, they can actually make your legs look longer and that can help out any body and any figure when you wear jeans.
05gjcxakphc_9-5-rgb_front	4.04	Boots are also a versatile and popular thing this winter.
05pLyheXjeo_0-5-rgb_front	5.25	Here I have another style of a criss cross strap, in a back view.
05pLyheXjeo_1-5-rgb_front	10.17	What I have done here, is show that the garment that it's criss crossing and attached to.
05pLyheXjeo_10-5-rgb_front	2.21	Only they're not braided.
05pLyheXjeo_11-5-rgb_front	2.12	But they criss cross each other.
05pLyheXjeo_12-5-rgb_front	1.25	They don't just cross.
05pLyheXjeo_13-5-rgb_front	1.5	They criss cross.
05pLyheXjeo_14-5-rgb_front	2.67	So there's cross and there's criss cross.
05pLyheXjeo_15-5-rgb_front	8.33	And then, it doesn't have to have, necessarily this many straps.
05pLyheXjeo_16-5-rgb_front	2.83	It could have more straps than this.
05pLyheXjeo_17-5-rgb_front	10.08	What it's showing is that somehow probably, they are going to be sewn in, to the back of it.
05pLyheXjeo_18-5-rgb_front	1.88	And maybe they attach in the front.
05pLyheXjeo_19-5-rgb_front	1.62	Or maybe they're stretchy.
05pLyheXjeo_2-5-rgb_front	2.38	is going straight across the back.
05pLyheXjeo_20-5-rgb_front	2.75	And it just gets, put over the head.
05pLyheXjeo_21-5-rgb_front	4.12	But this is just another version of a criss cross strap for neck.
05pLyheXjeo_3-5-rgb_front	1.5	There is your seam lines.
05pLyheXjeo_4-5-rgb_front	3.75	But the criss cross factor and remember this is a back view.
05pLyheXjeo_5-5-rgb_front	2.54	Because, I cut off her head.
05pLyheXjeo_6-5-rgb_front	3.04	When you see that, that means it's on the back.
05pLyheXjeo_7-5-rgb_front	3.71	I also have indicated back view, if you can't read it.
05pLyheXjeo_8-5-rgb_front	4.83	But the criss cross means that over, under, over, under.
05pLyheXjeo_9-5-rgb_front	0.96	Like they're braided.
05snMPwCV98_0-5-rgb_front	13.75	The next variation of a vest that you can design, or that you can build on, as far as your design process goes, and again, all this stuff is for you to just try.
05snMPwCV98_1-5-rgb_front	7.54	Don't take my ideas literally, because what I'm doing now, and don't take them as who I am as a designer, either.
05snMPwCV98_10-5-rgb_front	2.25	There's not really a term for that.
05snMPwCV98_11-5-rgb_front	5.5	It's just too short for being long, and too long for being shrunken.
05snMPwCV98_12-5-rgb_front	3.38	Shrunken is just shrunken all around.
05snMPwCV98_13-5-rgb_front	6.0	Ribbing, you know what a ribbing is, knit contrast to the regular knit that's there.
05snMPwCV98_2_3-5-rgb_front	23.83	I need to say that, because they're just shapes for you to build on. I'm doing the most basic and elementary things that I can think of, that give my concept a way of establishing itself in your head, and then letting you build on that concept.
05snMPwCV98_4-5-rgb_front	4.33	This is a shrunken sweater vest with ribbing.
05snMPwCV98_5-5-rgb_front	1.92	Everybody knows what that is.
05snMPwCV98_6-5-rgb_front	9.04	It's going to hit to be shrunken, and needs to hit above, above the hips.
05snMPwCV98_7-5-rgb_front	3.88	It needs to hit above the waist typically, or right at the waist.
05snMPwCV98_8-5-rgb_front	1.46	That's technically shrunken.
05snMPwCV98_9-5-rgb_front	6.46	If it hits a little bit below the waist, well, you just don't need to try it, because it shrinks.
05svBr3FJD4_1-5-rgb_front	107.46	This one is called X marks the spot and it's a little routine you do to try to give your child a chill with goose bumps all over, Ruckel is going to help us turn around so that I can see your back (hand motion) X marks the spot with a circle and a dot shrivel up shrivel down shrivel all around with a pinch and a squeeze and a nice cool breeze (blow) these are the chills (laughing) did you get goose bumps (ya) This one is called crack an egg on your head (hand motions) Crack an egg on your head let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down, crack an egg on your head let the yolk drip down squeeze an orange on your shoulders let the juice drip down let the juice drip down squeeze an orange on your shoulders let the juice drip down let the juice drip down, spiders crawling up your back spiders crawling down spiders crawling up your back spiders crawling down with a pinch and a squeeze and a cool ocean breeze (blow) did you feel the chills (ya)
06S7xXXHWIs_0-5-rgb_front	9.38	The final area to massage for a dog with, especially with problems with the front legs is going to be the side of the face, between the eye and the jaw.
06S7xXXHWIs_1-5-rgb_front	3.29	Again, this may be an area that a dog will object to.
06S7xXXHWIs_10-5-rgb_front	3.83	You get them used to it over time work them into it.
06S7xXXHWIs_11-5-rgb_front	8.5	Just get them used to a little bit of face touching, and then as they get calmer, you can do a little bit more, and a little bit more.
06S7xXXHWIs_2-5-rgb_front	1.96	Some dogs will really like it.
06S7xXXHWIs_3-5-rgb_front	10.25	If your dog will allow you to do it, those cheek muscles right between the eye and the bottom of the jaw, just a nice circular motion.
06S7xXXHWIs_4-5-rgb_front	4.5	You want to be a little bit more gentle in this area than you've been on the back.
06S7xXXHWIs_5-5-rgb_front	8.33	There's not as thick a muscle, and this is a good, relaxing pain relieving
06S7xXXHWIs_6-5-rgb_front	3.88	It's a continuation of one of those nice front leg meridians.
06S7xXXHWIs_7-5-rgb_front	3.12	So again, you're going to do the same on the other side.
06S7xXXHWIs_8-5-rgb_front	15.42	If the dog is nice and relaxed and quiet you can do both cheeks at once, and you're just going to do a nice broad fingertip or palm of the hand circular motion, and just relax that whole area.
06S7xXXHWIs_9-5-rgb_front	7.71	This is one
06St8W_JHok_0-5-rgb_front	6.0	The first step of our seascape is, surprise, surprise, not supplies.
06St8W_JHok_1-5-rgb_front	5.25	Actually, what we first want to do is decide what we want to paint.
06St8W_JHok_10-5-rgb_front	3.75	And this is kind of the next step, what makes a good picture?
06St8W_JHok_11-5-rgb_front	9.67	For example, this picture here on the left, oh that tree there and that gnarled piece of driftwood which has been pushed up right by the current in the sand.
06St8W_JHok_12-5-rgb_front	1.5	That's pretty interesting.
06St8W_JHok_13-5-rgb_front	2.92	But the problem is the framing's all wrong.
06St8W_JHok_14-5-rgb_front	7.67	This here in the foreground is kind of blocking out and distracting from the very interesting landscape back here behind.
06St8W_JHok_15-5-rgb_front	1.75	Most of which is water.
06St8W_JHok_16-5-rgb_front	4.5	Seascapes do not have to purely be just the sea.
06St8W_JHok_17-5-rgb_front	4.25	Actually, if you're ever painting just water it's kind of boring.
06St8W_JHok_18-5-rgb_front	6.83	It's nice to have a shoreline, some shore items, some froth and foam, some out cropping rocks.
06St8W_JHok_19-5-rgb_front	2.25	But this here is just too distracting.
06St8W_JHok_2-5-rgb_front	2.33	There are a variety of ways you can do this.
06St8W_JHok_20-5-rgb_front	2.96	Despite it being interesting, it's a no go.
06St8W_JHok_21-5-rgb_front	2.5	So this one, that's out.
06St8W_JHok_22-5-rgb_front	3.46	Now this one on the other hand, this one holds promise.
06St8W_JHok_23-5-rgb_front	7.54	You again, have a prominent sea on the side, a lot of water and beach and waves breaking in the surf here.
06St8W_JHok_24-5-rgb_front	11.5	And you have a really cool geological, basically, out cropping here which has been eroded around by the water but it's so tall it has fertile soil on the top.
06St8W_JHok_25-5-rgb_front	0.79	So this is great.
06St8W_JHok_26-5-rgb_front	1.54	This is like a little island.
06St8W_JHok_27-5-rgb_front	8.42	It is an island right in the middle of the sea with nice shears, strong lines, which is going to make for a very interesting subject for your seascape.
06St8W_JHok_3-5-rgb_front	7.21	First and foremost, if you can paint outdoors, you have a great beach nearby, get out of your house!
06St8W_JHok_4-5-rgb_front	5.67	Heck, you can stop watching this right now and run out after you see the remaining steps.
06St8W_JHok_5-5-rgb_front	1.62	That's the best way to do it.
06St8W_JHok_6-5-rgb_front	2.96	Up there, live, close and personal.
06St8W_JHok_7-5-rgb_front	2.12	So, go down to the beach and paint.
06St8W_JHok_8-5-rgb_front	2.25	Paint whatever strikes you as interesting.
06St8W_JHok_9-5-rgb_front	6.88	Now if you're not so lucky to live near the ocean then you have to rely on pictures.
06Yvm4X81WI_0-5-rgb_front	8.17	Let's start by talking about one of the most basic and archaic ways to cut a hole in the ice, and that's using a hand chisel.
06Yvm4X81WI_1-5-rgb_front	6.12	Now, safety again is always the most important aspect.
06Yvm4X81WI_10-5-rgb_front	7.92	But, they're great to have, especially for checking the ice, close to shore when you come out on a water body.
06Yvm4X81WI_11-5-rgb_front	11.67	There's really nothing much to it, other than simply taking a firm grasp on it, and just starting to cut into the ice.
06Yvm4X81WI_12-5-rgb_front	10.5	Chipping it out as you go, rotate the blade and just continue with it until you hit that water.
06Yvm4X81WI_13-5-rgb_front	9.42	One good tip is, and I don't have it here today, but is to always attach a rope with a tied loop to the top of this.
06Yvm4X81WI_14-5-rgb_front	15.29	You can put that around your wrist, put it around your shoulders, so just in case, when you finally go through, if you loose your grip on your chisel, you're not going to lose it, because your rope will help save it.
06Yvm4X81WI_2-5-rgb_front	4.04	The blades are these chisels are typically pretty sharp.
06Yvm4X81WI_3-5-rgb_front	3.71	You always want to cover them when they're not in use.
06Yvm4X81WI_4-5-rgb_front	9.5	You always want to be conscious of where that blade is, in relation to where you are, where your kids, where your friends are when you're fishing.
06Yvm4X81WI_5-5-rgb_front	2.46	Now, these chisels are great to have.
06Yvm4X81WI_6-5-rgb_front	7.5	I always bring one with me, especially early and late season, when the ice is thin.
06Yvm4X81WI_7-5-rgb_front	6.12	It's a great way to chop a quick hole, probably only take you a minute or so.
06Yvm4X81WI_8-5-rgb_front	11.17	During mid-winter, when the ice is thick, say even thicker than six, seven inches, using a hand chisel can be quite a task.
06Yvm4X81WI_9-5-rgb_front	4.08	Taking maybe upwards of five, six minutes to cut a decent hole.
06bQ_DxQGJU_0-5-rgb_front	14.03	Okay, in this segment I am going to serve to Ken, he is going to return his forehead up the line, he is going to return them down the middle and he is going to return them cross court.
06bQ_DxQGJU_1-5-rgb_front	6.9	It is very important that you practice hitting all your server turns to the different parts of the court.
06bQ_DxQGJU_2-5-rgb_front	13.67	For example, if you are playing doubles, you are going to want to learn to return all your balls cross court, because if you go up the line there is going to be player there ready to volley the ball.
06bQ_DxQGJU_3-5-rgb_front	23.8	Now there is exceptions to that because sometimes they will mix up where they stand but in singles your best return is generally down the middle, but if you the player you are playing is serving and he is rushing the net, you might not want to give it right to him, you might want to be on a hit an angle cross court or go down the line.
06bQ_DxQGJU_4-5-rgb_front	11.83	So Ken is going to demonstrate how to serve or turn the serve down the line, okay again.
06bQ_DxQGJU_5-5-rgb_front	4.37	Okay, that one went up the middle because he did not turn enough on the ball.
06bQ_DxQGJU_6-5-rgb_front	9.93	Down the line Ken, turn, turn, turn, good okay, now return it to me.
06bQ_DxQGJU_7-5-rgb_front	6.0	Okay that one is right up the middle, right up the middle, good shot.
06bQ_DxQGJU_8-5-rgb_front	38.75	Cross court, so you see how Ken has to move his body to go cross court and one more, okay so that is the idea is you want to be able to return to all different spots of the court and as you get more proficient you can hit them short, wider, angled, you can return them deep so you can move, you can keep the server off balance with a high quality return.
06d7cIO6KsA_0-5-rgb_front	6.88	From time to time many cats will have an episode of diarrhea.
06d7cIO6KsA_1-5-rgb_front	8.5	So one of the things that you want to do is check your litter box daily to see if the stool is normal.
06d7cIO6KsA_2-5-rgb_front	5.46	This stool in the middle of the box here is a completely normal stool.
06d7cIO6KsA_3-5-rgb_front	16.33	It is formed, and it is not too hard, it is definitely bend-able and, and, not so firm that you can't deform it.
06d7cIO6KsA_4-5-rgb_front	3.12	This, on the other hand is definitely diarrhea.
06d7cIO6KsA_5-5-rgb_front	7.42	This is soft, there's hardly any form to it and you can see that it's almost a pudding consistency.
06d7cIO6KsA_6-5-rgb_front	29.46	If at home your cat has diarrhea just one time and it seems to be otherwise healthy, it's playing, its eating normally, everything else is going well, you can try adding some soft cooked rice to your cat's food for a day or two, and if you're feeding a lot of treats, or if it's been getting any table food you'd want to discontinue that.
06d7cIO6KsA_7-5-rgb_front	9.83	Definitely if the diarrhea continues for more than a day then you should consult with your veterinarian about further treatment options.
06jk1stVwMI_0-5-rgb_front	5.23	Bridge pose is a classic finishing pose that can be done in prenatal yoga.
06jk1stVwMI_1-5-rgb_front	4.65	As long as it's still comfortable for you to be lying on your back.
06jk1stVwMI_10-5-rgb_front	2.82	Now press in the hips up to the sky.
06jk1stVwMI_11-5-rgb_front	6.3	Nice gentle strengthening of the spine, helps relieve some tension.
06jk1stVwMI_12-5-rgb_front	1.45	Keep looking straight up.
06jk1stVwMI_13-5-rgb_front	4.05	Whenever you have any constriction on the neck, not looking side to side.
06jk1stVwMI_14-5-rgb_front	6.15	Keep looking straight up to the sky, pressing your arms down into the mat.
06jk1stVwMI_15-5-rgb_front	5.45	If it's comfortable for you, if it's part of your practice, you can bring the arms underneath you into moodrem.
06jk1stVwMI_16-5-rgb_front	3.07	I think she prefers to bring it into moodrem.
06jk1stVwMI_17-5-rgb_front	0.58	Perfect.
06jk1stVwMI_18-5-rgb_front	3.38	Clasp the fingers together, press the arms into the mat.
06jk1stVwMI_19-5-rgb_front	3.9	You also have to come a little bit higher onto those shoulders, lovely.
06jk1stVwMI_2-5-rgb_front	1.08	Are you comfortable?
06jk1stVwMI_20-5-rgb_front	2.93	One more nice breath holding the pose.
06jk1stVwMI_21-5-rgb_front	2.4	Long complete exhale.
06jk1stVwMI_22-5-rgb_front	17.8	Release the hands out to your sides, press up onto your tippy toes, take a nice deep inhale, exhale very slowly, very gently, lowering down one vertebrae at a time.
06jk1stVwMI_23-5-rgb_front	5.48	Always going in and out of bridge as slow as you possibly can.
06jk1stVwMI_24-5-rgb_front	1.15	Perfect.
06jk1stVwMI_25-5-rgb_front	5.03	Whenever you're done, you can release the heels back towards the earth.
06jk1stVwMI_26-5-rgb_front	0.73	Beautiful.
06jk1stVwMI_3-5-rgb_front	4.15	I do have a blanket underneath her head for just a little bit of support on her neck.
06jk1stVwMI_4-5-rgb_front	1.58	Alright, bridge pose.
06jk1stVwMI_5-5-rgb_front	11.27	You want to bring your feet about hip width apart, heels slightly closer to the hips than you normally would, arms dropped down to your sides, palms on the earth.
06jk1stVwMI_6-5-rgb_front	2.68	Important to work with your breath in this pose.
06jk1stVwMI_7-5-rgb_front	1.48	Take a nice deep inhale.
06jk1stVwMI_8-5-rgb_front	3.97	As you exhale, press into the feet, lift the hips up slightly.
06jk1stVwMI_9-5-rgb_front	3.38	Now you don't want to take it to the full limit, perfect.
06k75HRlfqc_0-8-rgb_front	4.25	Hi my name is Ashley Ludman from Seaside Yoga here today to talk to you about hot yoga.
06k75HRlfqc_1-8-rgb_front	6.71	So a few years ago Bikram yoga was developed and franchised by Bikram Chadroy.
06k75HRlfqc_10-8-rgb_front	4.0	So hot yoga, hot room, hot practice, hope you enjoy it.
06k75HRlfqc_2-8-rgb_front	8.04	From that branched out a lot of styles of hot yoga that didn't really have anything to do with the franchise of Bikram yoga.
06k75HRlfqc_3-8-rgb_front	6.71	But in essence hot yoga is a yoga style that is practiced within a room that is deliberately heated.
06k75HRlfqc_4-8-rgb_front	3.17	Sometimes up to temperatures of a hundred and ten degrees.
06k75HRlfqc_5-8-rgb_front	6.75	And the purpose of heating the room in a hot yoga class is to create greater detoxification benefits.
06k75HRlfqc_6-8-rgb_front	8.38	So not only are you internally heating through your breath and through the movement of postures from one posture to the next, but the room is externally heated.
06k75HRlfqc_7-8-rgb_front	5.46	And there should be a little bit of humanity within that, that sphere of the room.
06k75HRlfqc_8-8-rgb_front	9.33	You may find various sequences in a hot yoga class where Bikram yoga is one particular sequence and one particular class of twenty six postures.
06k75HRlfqc_9-8-rgb_front	6.12	In the hot yoga class you may find that you are moving through postures in a more flowing way.
06tA1xvaSt8_0-5-rgb_front	9.02	Now, you'll notice with our edges, already sort of peeled away, you're like well, you know, some of the toners coming off, it all looks a little rugged.
06tA1xvaSt8_1-5-rgb_front	6.05	First off, some of the rugged, harder edged effects, that is part of the transfer.
06tA1xvaSt8_10-5-rgb_front	9.1	Cause, yeah, some of the toner will come off, that's part again, part of, sort of part of the effect, but you should still be able to very easily recognize the picture underneath.
06tA1xvaSt8_11-5-rgb_front	2.38	And you shouldn't be taking off big heaps of toner.
06tA1xvaSt8_12-5-rgb_front	2.18	That means you are scrubbing too hard.
06tA1xvaSt8_13-5-rgb_front	11.53	So, with the smooth side, we're going to work in here, all through out the middle, until we have all the paper, that we want all the paper fiber, is going to be off.
06tA1xvaSt8_2-5-rgb_front	8.23	You gotta keep in mind that a lot of those with smoother edges, that the grays and the whites are going to be reduced down to like, you know, darker than wood.
06tA1xvaSt8_3-5-rgb_front	8.37	What's more, if you discover, if you think too much toner's coming off, to the point where you're losing the image, odds are you're scrubbing too hard.
06tA1xvaSt8_4-5-rgb_front	3.48	Go from the rough side, to the smooth side.
06tA1xvaSt8_5-5-rgb_front	7.63	What's more, in terms of getting into, like, the really more detailed areas, where you're just going to be on the basic shape of the shoulder.
06tA1xvaSt8_6-5-rgb_front	13.97	I strong, strongly recommend just rubbing with the smooth side, and having a lot of water, cause this is going to help you, get even more of the paper off.
06tA1xvaSt8_7-5-rgb_front	9.42	And you'll notice that, you know, a lot of the toner underneath here, is staying on, much more so, than what you had on, lower below.
06tA1xvaSt8_8-5-rgb_front	4.53	But yeah, if you find out that a lot of it's coming off, stop scrubbing so hard.
06tA1xvaSt8_9-5-rgb_front	1.53	That's probably the big problem.
072DGdBjfkQ_0-5-rgb_front	5.17	The next Easter card I'm going to show you is a lot of fun and it has a film strip technique.
072DGdBjfkQ_1-5-rgb_front	5.58	Here's the card that we are going to be making and doesn't that look like a cute little film strip.
072DGdBjfkQ_10-5-rgb_front	5.37	When ever you are using the punches, the punch always has to be up so you can see where you are punching.
072DGdBjfkQ_11-5-rgb_front	6.2	So there is one, two, three for our film strip.
072DGdBjfkQ_12-5-rgb_front	5.63	Now I won't cut out the chick punches until I've stamped on them.
072DGdBjfkQ_13-5-rgb_front	4.72	It makes it a lot easier for me to see the images where I need them.
072DGdBjfkQ_14-5-rgb_front	2.85	So let me go ahead and stamp three chicks.
072DGdBjfkQ_15-5-rgb_front	3.45	And I'm just stamping my chicks in black.
072DGdBjfkQ_16-5-rgb_front	7.57	And what I want to do, I want to capture him, I got a little smudge so I need to stamp one more time.
072DGdBjfkQ_17-5-rgb_front	4.25	What I want to do here is capture him at three different stages.
072DGdBjfkQ_18-5-rgb_front	7.18	Where he is just peaking, where he's got the middle of his body and then the top of his body kind of pulling out of the screen.
072DGdBjfkQ_19-5-rgb_front	5.43	So by doing that what I'm going to do is use my square, line them up.
072DGdBjfkQ_2-5-rgb_front	5.77	You can use this card again, for any card, any season but we are going to be doing Easter.
072DGdBjfkQ_20-5-rgb_front	2.68	The first one I want is just going to be his nose.
072DGdBjfkQ_21_22-5-rgb_front	6.48	I'm going to punch that out. The middle one is going to be his body, I'm going to punch that out.
072DGdBjfkQ_23-5-rgb_front	5.53	And the last one is going to be his body but he's going to be kind of leaving the scene.
072DGdBjfkQ_24-5-rgb_front	11.8	So I need to get a little bit in here and I'm just going to get the top of my chick.
072DGdBjfkQ_25-5-rgb_front	7.48	Sometimes you have to cut your little paper a little bit just to get your puncher and there is my third.
072DGdBjfkQ_26-5-rgb_front	3.58	So I have all my punches done and now I can start coloring.
072DGdBjfkQ_3-5-rgb_front	2.2	So let me get started.
072DGdBjfkQ_4-5-rgb_front	2.83	First thing I'm going to do is cut and score my paper.
072DGdBjfkQ_5-5-rgb_front	8.12	I need a piece of wild wasabi at five and a half times four and a quarter where I'm going to be scoring.
072DGdBjfkQ_6-5-rgb_front	1.48	That's my card base.
072DGdBjfkQ_7-5-rgb_front	11.18	And then I need a piece of the black which is going to be the film strip and I'm going to cut that at two and three quarters times five and a half which is the length of the card.
072DGdBjfkQ_8-5-rgb_front	7.0	Alright now the next pieces that we are going to be using, I don't need my cutters for, we are going to have fun with punching.
072DGdBjfkQ_9-5-rgb_front	4.47	I need three squares of the so saffron.
075s9DECj2k_1-5-rgb_front	13.08	Now I have shown you all of the drills that are necessary to master before you can get a nice clean backhand spring and move on to a more advance skill like a back tuck.
075s9DECj2k_10-5-rgb_front	3.85	This is a backhand spring again on a floor.
075s9DECj2k_2-5-rgb_front	17.72	So keeping in mind all of those drills that I have shown you watch my backhand spring on this floor and see how everything I have done up to this moment leads me up to right here.
075s9DECj2k_3-5-rgb_front	6.63	It is very important to be implemented into my technique using my backhand spring.
075s9DECj2k_4-5-rgb_front	7.33	Watch how I jump off my toes last just like I did on the trampoline.
075s9DECj2k_5-5-rgb_front	13.12	Watch how I extend my arms past my shoulders just like I did in the jump back and swing my arms quickly as I did in the arm string drill.
075s9DECj2k_6-5-rgb_front	7.57	My sit is going to be very similar if not identical to the set that I did up against the wedge mat.
075s9DECj2k_7-5-rgb_front	4.77	My arms are going to be nice and straight as they were in all the drills that I have showed you.
075s9DECj2k_8-5-rgb_front	7.83	I?m going to block with my shoulders rather than bending my elbows like I did in all the blocking drills that I have showed you.
075s9DECj2k_9-5-rgb_front	13.63	You are really going to be able to see how important it is to slow down, take the time to master each element of the backhand spring before tackling the backhand spring as a whole.
077IIb5uuCs_0_1_2-5-rgb_front	10.33	Alright, juggling three clubs, alright we discussed how to hold two in one hand. We discussed every aspect. Now, it's the time to do it.
077IIb5uuCs_10-5-rgb_front	3.22	If I stand sideways, you'll get a better look.
077IIb5uuCs_11-5-rgb_front	11.65	They're nice, slow, single rotations and it's not because of how I'm spinning them, it's because of how high I'm throwing them.
077IIb5uuCs_12-5-rgb_front	7.17	Of course, it is possible to spin them faster but like I said before it's not necessary.
077IIb5uuCs_13-5-rgb_front	6.7	Spinning them faster is another trick in itself just throwing them is hard enough for most people.
077IIb5uuCs_3-5-rgb_front	15.48	Okay, it's just like juggling three balls except you have to be careful because if you throw them so that they will go away from your body or towards your body, there's a much greater chance of you hitting yourself in the face.
077IIb5uuCs_4-5-rgb_front	1.27	I've been hit in the mouth.
077IIb5uuCs_5-5-rgb_front	1.18	I've been hit in the eye.
077IIb5uuCs_6-5-rgb_front	2.8	I had seen people do both and it hurts.
077IIb5uuCs_7-5-rgb_front	14.15	So, you got to be careful when you first start okay and it's like most things not as hard as it looks to you when you first start.
077IIb5uuCs_8-5-rgb_front	8.17	It's way slower than you think but this is how it looks okay.
077IIb5uuCs_9-5-rgb_front	6.58	If you notice, it's nice, slow, single rotations.
077rQK39ycg_1-5-rgb_front	4.04	We're moving on to the next step in our quick Thai curry.
077rQK39ycg_10-5-rgb_front	1.88	They're not going to be overdone.
077rQK39ycg_11-5-rgb_front	3.67	So everything that we're going to cook today is cooked very quickly.
077rQK39ycg_12-5-rgb_front	3.29	This is not a long cooking process that we're going to be doing.
077rQK39ycg_13-5-rgb_front	2.38	Looks like our wok is ready to go.
077rQK39ycg_14-5-rgb_front	6.83	The first thing we're going to do is add at least one or two cloves of garlic.
077rQK39ycg_15-5-rgb_front	2.21	Get that in and get that going.
077rQK39ycg_16-5-rgb_front	5.33	That's a nice base flavor for anything that we're going to be cooking today.
077rQK39ycg_17-5-rgb_front	26.88	And then the next thing we're going to add are our heavier vegetables, like our carrot, our onion and today we're using peppers.
077rQK39ycg_18-5-rgb_front	1.92	So let's get our peppers in there.
077rQK39ycg_19-5-rgb_front	10.08	You want to make sure that your vegetables are in.
077rQK39ycg_2-5-rgb_front	4.71	Now we've got our vegetables ready to go that we've talked about.
077rQK39ycg_20-5-rgb_front	2.38	Toss your vegetables around.
077rQK39ycg_21-5-rgb_front	0.71	Okay.
077rQK39ycg_22-5-rgb_front	1.62	There's our vegetables.
077rQK39ycg_23-5-rgb_front	8.42	We're stirring them, keeping them moving so that they cook evenly in the wok.
077rQK39ycg_24-5-rgb_front	7.58	It's important that you do keep them moving so that you don't end up with your vegetables cooked unevenly.
077rQK39ycg_25-5-rgb_front	8.0	If you were cooking with broccoli or another harder vegetable like that, you'd also want those in at this time.
077rQK39ycg_26-5-rgb_front	1.75	Just keep moving that around.
077rQK39ycg_27-5-rgb_front	2.0	You can leave it periodically.
077rQK39ycg_28-5-rgb_front	6.62	Let the vegetables heat up and in about thirty seconds or so come on back, keep it moving again.
077rQK39ycg_29-5-rgb_front	3.5	In a minute we'll be back and talk about the next step in our dinner.
077rQK39ycg_3-5-rgb_front	3.38	We're firing up our wok.
077rQK39ycg_4-5-rgb_front	2.71	A little bit of oil on the bottom of the wok.
077rQK39ycg_5-5-rgb_front	2.38	Get that hot and ready to go.
077rQK39ycg_6-5-rgb_front	5.21	The first thing you want to add to your wok are your fresh vegetables.
077rQK39ycg_7-5-rgb_front	9.17	If you're using frozen vegetables, you want to take those out of their package, let them defrost for a couple of minutes.
077rQK39ycg_8-5-rgb_front	12.38	If you're mixing fresh and frozen, you definitely want to get your frozen vegetables out so they're maybe up to almost room temperature so that everything is going to cook at the same pace.
077rQK39ycg_9-5-rgb_front	7.46	When we're cooking with a wok and cooking Thai food, your vegetables are going to be crispy.
079tjgCukM4_0-5-rgb_front	5.83	In this segment I'm going to talk about unleashing your spirit from singing.
079tjgCukM4_1-5-rgb_front	8.62	As much as technique is important, nothing can beat the importance of artistry.
079tjgCukM4_2-5-rgb_front	9.42	There is a point where you just have to let technique go, you have to just let it sink down naturally in your body and then you have to forget about it.
079tjgCukM4_3-5-rgb_front	12.17	I mean if I where overly concerned about technique the place, the opening of my mouth, I will survive, I will survive.
079tjgCukM4_4-5-rgb_front	2.62	I mean but I have to let it go.
079tjgCukM4_5-5-rgb_front	2.17	I have to be afraid to make mistakes.
079tjgCukM4_6-5-rgb_front	7.38	It feels like jumping off the cliff I will survive, I will survive.
079tjgCukM4_7-5-rgb_front	12.29	Here is the thing it feels terrifying, I mean until you get really use to singing in front of people it is terrifying and there is a reason for that.
079tjgCukM4_8-5-rgb_front	10.17	You really are exposing your soul but just know that you are safe people generally don't judge people who take a risk.
07EGkSiMsL0_0-5-rgb_front	1.54	Now I'm ready to treat.
07EGkSiMsL0_1-5-rgb_front	2.12	I've prepped Matt.
07EGkSiMsL0_10-5-rgb_front	0.88	There we go.
07EGkSiMsL0_11-5-rgb_front	1.71	It's treated perfect.
07EGkSiMsL0_12-5-rgb_front	1.71	So now we continue.
07EGkSiMsL0_13-5-rgb_front	7.38	Now that I know what it takes, I'm off and running.
07EGkSiMsL0_14-5-rgb_front	1.0	There we go.
07EGkSiMsL0_15-5-rgb_front	17.38	Another hair another hair, and this is the blend.
07EGkSiMsL0_16-5-rgb_front	3.71	So this is a little slower than if it was high frequency.
07EGkSiMsL0_17-5-rgb_front	7.79	High frequency would be probably almost half the time to treat as it is the blend.
07EGkSiMsL0_18-5-rgb_front	18.04	But it's the numbers on that treatment is somewhere in the forty percentile,fifty percentile,with high frequency vs. up to eighty nine or ninety per cent kill ratio, when you use the blend.
07EGkSiMsL0_19-5-rgb_front	1.62	So I like those numbers.
07EGkSiMsL0_2-5-rgb_front	2.58	I've got his hair ready.
07EGkSiMsL0_20-5-rgb_front	7.12	So that's kind of why I go that direction, and I don't like fast and hot and quick.
07EGkSiMsL0_21-5-rgb_front	6.08	You have too much imperfection in the work, as far as I'm concerned.
07EGkSiMsL0_3-5-rgb_front	5.75	We've spoke about what he'd like and what treatment he wants.
07EGkSiMsL0_4-5-rgb_front	2.79	He's made the decision of electrology.
07EGkSiMsL0_5-5-rgb_front	2.25	So now, we're going to start our work.
07EGkSiMsL0_6-5-rgb_front	3.17	I have the timer on and we're working.
07EGkSiMsL0_7-5-rgb_front	22.83	Now these hairs are growing downward and there is a kind of, this way that I hold the probe in my hand and I taunt that skin, so I get that hair just at the right angle, and then in we go, and then to see what it takes to do Matt's hair in the back.
07EGkSiMsL0_8-5-rgb_front	2.04	This hair is a little bit different.
07EGkSiMsL0_9-5-rgb_front	6.12	I need to go a little bit deeper and stay a little bit longer.
07HhpnroTXs_0-5-rgb_front	6.79	We've chosen a pink, silver and black theme for this one and that can go anywhere.
07HhpnroTXs_1-5-rgb_front	9.33	And just want to let you know that you can be creative and take this theme wherever it can go.
07HhpnroTXs_2-5-rgb_front	7.71	Like say you're having a Hannah Montana party which is one of the most popular themes going right now.
07HhpnroTXs_3-5-rgb_front	12.17	So you can grab anything Hannah Montana like these little blowouts and stick them in the centerpiece or just stick them on the top so her picture is showing.
07HhpnroTXs_4-5-rgb_front	18.0	You can even use an invitation or just anything with her picture and just put it on the top or another good idea is to get just the paper plates and tape them together, just two plates like this, faced out.
07HhpnroTXs_5-5-rgb_front	7.62	And just put them on the top and it like really lets your guests know really what your theme is.
07HhpnroTXs_6-5-rgb_front	8.0	And when they walk in they see the table and they know that they can be celebrating your birthday with Hannah Montana.
07TdlpHnhtU_0-5-rgb_front	4.04	In order to string jewelry, you're going to need something to put it on.
07TdlpHnhtU_1-5-rgb_front	4.88	I actually started out with fishing line, and you can make knots in it.
07TdlpHnhtU_10-5-rgb_front	2.92	And you can just stretch it over your arm, like that.
07TdlpHnhtU_11-5-rgb_front	7.58	You do a full knot with both strands or a square knot with that.
07TdlpHnhtU_12-5-rgb_front	3.21	And I also use memory wire.
07TdlpHnhtU_13-5-rgb_front	3.17	Memory wire goes back to its original form.
07TdlpHnhtU_14-5-rgb_front	2.17	Here is a necklace and a bracelet.
07TdlpHnhtU_15-5-rgb_front	1.96	You don't have to have a clasp with it.
07TdlpHnhtU_16-5-rgb_front	3.08	It just goes back, like that.
07TdlpHnhtU_2-5-rgb_front	1.88	But I don't have that today.
07TdlpHnhtU_3-5-rgb_front	7.5	I use nylon-coated steel wire, or tiger tail, is what they call it.
07TdlpHnhtU_4-5-rgb_front	2.62	And there are different diameters.
07TdlpHnhtU_5-5-rgb_front	6.67	There's really thick and really thin, depending on how heavy your necklace is or how heavy your beads are.
07TdlpHnhtU_6-5-rgb_front	1.88	And here are some samples.
07TdlpHnhtU_7-5-rgb_front	2.12	This is all done with tiger tail.
07TdlpHnhtU_8-5-rgb_front	4.67	And that's basically what I use to make basic necklaces.
07TdlpHnhtU_9-5-rgb_front	9.33	And there's also stretchy cord, which everybody knows about power bracelets, and that's what they're put on.
07U8pEf63Pw_0-5-rgb_front	5.08	Now it's time for the first of the off body tricks.
07U8pEf63Pw_1-5-rgb_front	3.25	This trick is called the lasso.
07U8pEf63Pw_10-5-rgb_front	3.96	You can kind of isolate it, spinning it around.
07U8pEf63Pw_11-5-rgb_front	6.46	If you'd like to, you can even drop down on the floor and strike some hot pinup girl poses in it.
07U8pEf63Pw_12-5-rgb_front	2.75	You can take your hands up in prayer.
07U8pEf63Pw_13-5-rgb_front	2.25	You can do the right.
07U8pEf63Pw_14-5-rgb_front	1.38	You can do the left.
07U8pEf63Pw_15-5-rgb_front	4.0	You can even take it and isolate it somewhat holding it there.
07U8pEf63Pw_16-5-rgb_front	4.75	Have a lot of fun with this move.
07U8pEf63Pw_17-5-rgb_front	4.42	Lifting it up and away from the body.
07U8pEf63Pw_18-5-rgb_front	1.92	Squatting down.
07U8pEf63Pw_19-5-rgb_front	2.08	Make this move your own.
07U8pEf63Pw_2-5-rgb_front	1.58	I wonder why.
07U8pEf63Pw_20-5-rgb_front	1.83	You ready to give it a try?
07U8pEf63Pw_3-5-rgb_front	0.96	Yee-haw!.
07U8pEf63Pw_4-5-rgb_front	2.88	It kind of feels and looks like you're a cowboy.
07U8pEf63Pw_5-5-rgb_front	2.17	This is great move.
07U8pEf63Pw_6-5-rgb_front	2.83	It's strengthens the arms.
07U8pEf63Pw_7-5-rgb_front	5.46	It's nice and big, so you can clear space with it.
07U8pEf63Pw_8-5-rgb_front	7.88	It's also one of the moves that you will move in and out of throughout your whole hooping routine.
07U8pEf63Pw_9-5-rgb_front	1.25	You can turn with it.
07ViW5BdEsw_0-1-rgb_front	5.88	Hi it's Dow here at the Firehouse Detail Center, today we're detailing the exterior of your car and we're teaching you how to be an expert at doing it as well.
07ViW5BdEsw_1-1-rgb_front	2.0	In a previous segment we applied wax.
07ViW5BdEsw_10-1-rgb_front	12.38	Once its been hazed over and its had a chance to dry then we want to circle back using a microfiber towel, and again have several towels, turn it frequently, use a clean area of the towel to remove it.
07ViW5BdEsw_11-1-rgb_front	5.25	You're going to want to remove it the same direction you put it on which is the way that the wind flows over the car back and forth.
07ViW5BdEsw_12-1-rgb_front	9.29	We're going to go back and forth covering new areas, again flipping my towel frequently, so that I've got a fresh new area as I go over it.
07ViW5BdEsw_13-1-rgb_front	4.08	Now when I hit an area like this detail trim here where the headlight is.
07ViW5BdEsw_14-1-rgb_front	5.17	If I've got wax in there I can get a detail brush to go through and remove wax.
07ViW5BdEsw_15-1-rgb_front	11.75	I can even, you know, wrap a towel in it and go into the crevices, or fold a towel if I've got a bumper line like that I can fold the towel and just press it along the crevice like that.
07ViW5BdEsw_16_17-1-rgb_front	18.83	When it comes out it's gone in and it's removed any excess wax. You can move through the car wax removal pretty quickly, but pay attention to details because when you have too much wax in a crevice that's an area that's going to make your customer disappointed and you're not going to like the way it looks on your own vehicle if you're a do it yourselfer.
07ViW5BdEsw_18-1-rgb_front	11.21	With that, the microfiber towel will leave a nice shine and the paint finish is going to be just perfect for ninety to one hundred and twenty days.
07ViW5BdEsw_19-1-rgb_front	8.75	You can go back and reapply wax more often than that, but we find that our customers are delighted for at least ninety or one hundred and twenty days.
07ViW5BdEsw_2-1-rgb_front	3.08	We talked about the selection of wax and picking the wax that's best for you.
07ViW5BdEsw_3-1-rgb_front	5.12	An important part of waxing the car is actually the removal of the wax.
07ViW5BdEsw_4-1-rgb_front	8.17	We want to use the right equipment to remove it, and we want to make sure we remove wax in the crevices and cracks.
07ViW5BdEsw_5-1-rgb_front	7.38	So we don't want to fly through this too fast because you'll have a disappointed customer or you'll be disappointed at the look of your vehicle if you've got excess wax.
07ViW5BdEsw_6-1-rgb_front	2.79	So be cautious not to put too much wax to begin with.
07ViW5BdEsw_7-1-rgb_front	2.92	One of the common problems we have is people use too much wax.
07ViW5BdEsw_8-1-rgb_front	3.46	You just don't need a ton, a tremendous amount of product.
07ViW5BdEsw_9-1-rgb_front	2.25	A little bit of wax goes a long ways.
07mFG9turoU_0-5-rgb_front	9.96	So our next exercise is called the scissor as you might know, or the correct Pilates term would be the single straight leg stretch.
07mFG9turoU_10-5-rgb_front	0.38	Yes.
07mFG9turoU_11-5-rgb_front	2.83	From here grab onto your right ankle.
07mFG9turoU_12-5-rgb_front	3.79	If you can't reach you can grab onto your right knee as well.
07mFG9turoU_13-5-rgb_front	2.5	Scissor the left leg all the way down.
07mFG9turoU_14-5-rgb_front	5.21	So you're going to use your exhale here as you pulse the leg in twice towards your face.
07mFG9turoU_15-5-rgb_front	2.96	So your hand position should be onto your ankle.
07mFG9turoU_16-5-rgb_front	5.58	If you're having trouble reaching your ankle you can come down to your calf or even back to the knee.
07mFG9turoU_17-5-rgb_front	2.58	The most important thing is that your leg stays straight.
07mFG9turoU_18-5-rgb_front	1.92	You don't want to pull in a bent leg.
07mFG9turoU_19-5-rgb_front	3.0	You want to keep it long and lean.
07mFG9turoU_1_2_3_4-5-rgb_front	8.29	Ok. That's a lot of Ss in there. So let's get started. Mark's going to lay all the way down. Beautiful.
07mFG9turoU_20-5-rgb_front	4.46	So breathing is very important on this next exercise as well as the others.
07mFG9turoU_21-5-rgb_front	5.12	You want to make sure that you're bell button scoops in in as you exhale.
07mFG9turoU_22-5-rgb_front	3.88	So your belly button presses down, down and then you switch.
07mFG9turoU_23-5-rgb_front	3.04	Belly button goes down, down and switch.
07mFG9turoU_24-5-rgb_front	7.42	You compact those muscles into that breath so you're contracting those muscles as well as working them at the same time.
07mFG9turoU_25-5-rgb_front	2.25	It creates a longer leaner muscle.
07mFG9turoU_26-5-rgb_front	4.83	So you have exhale, whoo, whoo, and switch, navel scoops.
07mFG9turoU_27-5-rgb_front	2.88	See your navel pushing in, in on that exhale.
07mFG9turoU_28-5-rgb_front	0.38	Press.
07mFG9turoU_29-5-rgb_front	0.29	Press.
07mFG9turoU_30-5-rgb_front	0.75	Long legs.
07mFG9turoU_31-5-rgb_front	1.88	Stretch and lengthen those legs.
07mFG9turoU_32-5-rgb_front	0.54	Pulse.
07mFG9turoU_33-5-rgb_front	0.38	Pulse.
07mFG9turoU_34-5-rgb_front	1.33	Stay curled up.
07mFG9turoU_35-5-rgb_front	0.33	Pulse.
07mFG9turoU_36-5-rgb_front	0.17	Pulse.
07mFG9turoU_37-5-rgb_front	6.38	So notice Mark's upper body is not moving here it's just the legs moving so you're getting those lower abs working.
07mFG9turoU_38-5-rgb_front	0.33	Good.
07mFG9turoU_39-5-rgb_front	0.92	Give me three more.
07mFG9turoU_40-5-rgb_front	10.04	Three, and press, and two, straight out, press, last one, and one.
07mFG9turoU_41-5-rgb_front	2.04	Draw the knees in towards the chest.
07mFG9turoU_42-5-rgb_front	2.58	Relax head, neck and shoulders all the way down.
07mFG9turoU_43-5-rgb_front	1.04	Take a rest.
07mFG9turoU_44-5-rgb_front	5.42	The next clip with be the single, no the double straight leg stretch.
07mFG9turoU_5-5-rgb_front	2.21	From here you're going to bend your knees into your chest.
07mFG9turoU_6-5-rgb_front	4.0	Again, that proximal position, curl the head, neck and shoulders up.
07mFG9turoU_7-5-rgb_front	2.58	From here the legs go straight up in the air.
07mFG9turoU_8-5-rgb_front	1.96	Reach the toes toward the ceiling.
07mFG9turoU_9-5-rgb_front	4.25	If you have trouble straightening the back of your hamstrings flex the feet.
07n9gNTlVdI_0-5-rgb_front	0.75	ABE TOKE: Hi.
07n9gNTlVdI_10-5-rgb_front	7.62	Once you start shaping off the bottom a little bit, you'll notice that the stringer will start to pop up.
07n9gNTlVdI_11-5-rgb_front	8.5	That's when it's a great time to break out this hand planer and just hit the stringer alone.
07n9gNTlVdI_12-5-rgb_front	15.42	Careful not to--you don't want to reshape this bottom that much so you just really want to just take as consistent smooth cut off the stringer.
07n9gNTlVdI_13-5-rgb_front	19.96	I usually start somewhere around the apex of the bottom contour which is generally around the middle of the board and just flow right off the nose.
07n9gNTlVdI_14-5-rgb_front	9.79	Once I'm pretty happy with the relatively flat, I got most of the marks out.
07n9gNTlVdI_15-5-rgb_front	3.25	I'm going to go ahead and flip it over.
07n9gNTlVdI_16-5-rgb_front	22.33	The stringer is pretty hard to shape, so I usually tend to get that down and then you can shape the foam to the stringer, starting on the high points always first.
07n9gNTlVdI_2-5-rgb_front	5.67	I'm going to take you through step by step to shape yourself a complete surfboard.
07n9gNTlVdI_3-5-rgb_front	9.12	I'm going to go ahead and clean up this bottom a little bit, and then we'll go ahead and do the top.
07n9gNTlVdI_4_5-5-rgb_front	20.0	And I'm going to clean it up with the shearform again. When you run your hands across the bottom, you can really feel a high spot or a low spot.
07n9gNTlVdI_6-5-rgb_front	11.58	I mean you can obviously see that we're a little low here still, but just keeping--you don't want to dig in to this and try to make it up right now.
07n9gNTlVdI_7-5-rgb_front	5.79	So just keep on shaping the board is one whole thing.
07n9gNTlVdI_8-5-rgb_front	13.0	Don't stop in here and dig away and trying to hit a home run with every little stroke.
07n9gNTlVdI_9-5-rgb_front	9.25	It's more important that it really stays flat.
08JotxFsA4Y_0-5-rgb_front	5.71	Now that we have a clean palette, we're going to move on to the eyebrows.
08JotxFsA4Y_1-5-rgb_front	11.88	I'm going to go ahead and fill in Amy's eyebrows, you can use eyebrow liner, in this case I'm going to use powder.
08JotxFsA4Y_10-5-rgb_front	23.25	Same thing, I put the puff down, so I don't lift off of her skin on yourself you probably wouldn't do this, but if you're playing with somebody else?s eyebrows and filling in somebody else?s eyebrows if you, it's a good little trick so that you don't lift off any of the foundation.
08JotxFsA4Y_2-5-rgb_front	18.96	A lot of makeup artists that I know, use powder as well instead of the actual liner, it just gives it a softer, more subtle look than the harshness of a liner.
08JotxFsA4Y_3-5-rgb_front	29.75	So, I'm going to pick out the color that I think is closest to her eyebrow and I'm going to use an angled brush like this, and this is my favorite brush for filling in the eyebrows, I use it on myself, I use it on all of my clients, this brush, you can get this brush pretty much at every makeup counter.
08JotxFsA4Y_4-5-rgb_front	7.62	I'm not sure if you can get it at drugstores, but I know you can get it at every makeup counter, you can get it at you can get it at any beauty supply store.
08JotxFsA4Y_5-5-rgb_front	8.12	So, you're just going to take a little of that eye shadow is what I'm using.
08JotxFsA4Y_6-5-rgb_front	27.33	And another cool little trick is so that I don't lift makeup off of her skin, I'm going to apply the puff onto her cheek and rest my hand here while I apply the eye shadow onto her eyebrow or fill in her eyebrows.
08JotxFsA4Y_7-5-rgb_front	25.04	So, now I'm just taking this angled brush and I'm stroking upwards, filling in her eyebrows where it's needed and then I'll come back for more product once I run out and you want to just again slough off some of the excess eye shadow that you may have.
08JotxFsA4Y_8-5-rgb_front	2.25	See how it's filling in really nicely?
08JotxFsA4Y_9-5-rgb_front	3.5	The difference between the two eyebrows (Can I have your chin over here?)?
08PDyCn-pxI_1-5-rgb_front	8.75	What we want to talk about right now is the importance of our linebackers in the 4-3 set against a passing team.
08PDyCn-pxI_10-5-rgb_front	5.75	The middle linebacker has to drop back, and he is covering in this middle area.
08PDyCn-pxI_11-5-rgb_front	4.67	This guys got a big job, because he's got more receivers to his side.
08PDyCn-pxI_12-5-rgb_front	6.29	So he's got to cheat to the strong side of the field where there are the majority of the receivers.
08PDyCn-pxI_13-5-rgb_front	5.88	And this guy got to try to pick up to see if they are slipping anybody out of the backfield.
08PDyCn-pxI_14-5-rgb_front	6.25	Or if this wide receiver is going to cut off on a short route, then this linebackers going to step up.
08PDyCn-pxI_15-5-rgb_front	5.54	So he's got the outside responsibilities, the middle linebacker has got anything back here.
08PDyCn-pxI_16-5-rgb_front	12.04	But the main thing is, once they read a pass they got to get in a back peddle, pick up the quarterbacks eyes, and then find somebody to cover.
08PDyCn-pxI_17-5-rgb_front	4.88	And that's how you play linebacker dropping back in pass coverage.
08PDyCn-pxI_2-5-rgb_front	9.0	Now most of the time if you are running a 4-3 defense, you are running against a team that runs about as much as they pass.
08PDyCn-pxI_3-5-rgb_front	7.88	So these linebackers have to be very athletic and very versatile to be able to adjust to whatever is going on.
08PDyCn-pxI_4-5-rgb_front	15.38	So the first responsibility any time the ball is snapped is, our linebackers have to take a step up, they have to search the gaps, they have to pick up to see whether to run the play or if its going to be a pass play.
08PDyCn-pxI_5-5-rgb_front	2.0	And they are going to be reading the quarterback.
08PDyCn-pxI_6-5-rgb_front	7.92	If the quarterback plays action fakes, a lot of time the linebackers are going to sucked up another step.
08PDyCn-pxI_7-5-rgb_front	2.62	So these guys have to be able to react quick.
08PDyCn-pxI_8-5-rgb_front	4.25	If it?s not a fake and the quarterback starts a drop back.
08PDyCn-pxI_9-5-rgb_front	3.88	These guys first of all have to know their assignments.
08UdcMPnTyU_0-5-rgb_front	8.25	One arm row, the goal of the exercise is to work posterior delt, rhomboids, and lats.
08UdcMPnTyU_1-5-rgb_front	5.71	So it is just kind of like you are starting a lawnmower is how I like to refer to it.
08UdcMPnTyU_2-5-rgb_front	13.08	Make sure that you have got a good stable wide stance, knee in line with the ankle, don't show the chair the knee forward in front of the toe.
08UdcMPnTyU_3-5-rgb_front	32.04	We are going to bring it down slightly on the diagonal and our goal is to inhale and exhale and draw that elbow right up to the side to where we feel contraction back here, we don't want to feel the shoulder try to compress to the ear, we want to leave that nice and flat so inhale and boom right there, put it right back here, control it down.
08UdcMPnTyU_4-5-rgb_front	4.75	You are working against gravity here so it is a great exercise.
08UdcMPnTyU_5-5-rgb_front	6.17	Make sure that your hand is above the knee joint on the supporting leg.
08UdcMPnTyU_6-5-rgb_front	9.46	Working 10 to 15 reps, 3 sets on each side.
08hX7LrGPZQ_0-5-rgb_front	8.12	Hi I'm Kelli, I'm an aesthetician and a makeup artist at Ulta Salon and Cosmetics and I'm going to show you how you can apply a powder foundation.
08hX7LrGPZQ_1-5-rgb_front	6.5	You have a couple of different ways that you can apply a powder foundation depending on how much coverage you want.
08hX7LrGPZQ_10-5-rgb_front	8.0	So you can just see the difference between the two sides of her face, lighter coverage, fuller coverage.
08hX7LrGPZQ_11-5-rgb_front	3.42	So those are two ways you can apply powder foundation.
08hX7LrGPZQ_2-5-rgb_front	5.38	For a fuller coverage, you would want to apply it with a sponge.
08hX7LrGPZQ_3-5-rgb_front	3.62	For a lighter coverage, you would want to apply it with a brush.
08hX7LrGPZQ_4-5-rgb_front	12.58	So just to demonstrate, going to do a lighter coverage on one half of her face and a darker coverage on the other half.
08hX7LrGPZQ_5-5-rgb_front	4.33	So we're just going to dust this all over using a brush.
08hX7LrGPZQ_6-5-rgb_front	2.21	Just even out her skin tone.
08hX7LrGPZQ_7-5-rgb_front	6.46	So you can see it gives her some coverage but it doesn't necessarily give her a really full coverage.
08hX7LrGPZQ_8-5-rgb_front	3.33	So if I want a fuller coverage, I'm going to use a sponge.

08nsvHZLNfE_0-5-rgb_front	2.54	Hi I'm Joe Cuenco with Family Resources.
08nsvHZLNfE_1-5-rgb_front	4.29	Today we're going to be talking about not to live the rest of our life alone.
08nsvHZLNfE_10-5-rgb_front	3.92	Do you want to be with somebody's who a University Professor.
08nsvHZLNfE_11-5-rgb_front	6.04	Do you want to work with somebody or be with somebody who's maybe in the architectural trades?
08nsvHZLNfE_12-5-rgb_front	3.29	Or somebody's who involved in sports.
08nsvHZLNfE_13-5-rgb_front	6.5	Perhaps you need to find somebody's who's, who's a marathoner because those things are important to you.
08nsvHZLNfE_14-5-rgb_front	10.29	But you really need to, really need to take a look at what your, your life styles are and try and match those up with your potential partner.
08nsvHZLNfE_15-5-rgb_front	5.79	The first part is really doing an introspective look in improving your own self confidence.
08nsvHZLNfE_16-5-rgb_front	9.42	That comes from educating yourself
08nsvHZLNfE_17-5-rgb_front	4.88	You need to find somebody that has the relationship fundamentals down.
08nsvHZLNfE_18-5-rgb_front	8.42	Somebody who's going to love you, you can trust, communicate with you, respect you and be your friend for life.
08nsvHZLNfE_19-5-rgb_front	8.75	And if these things are not there then you're really going to have a difficulty or difficult time moving the relationship, relationship to the next level.
08nsvHZLNfE_2-5-rgb_front	3.58	Specifically how to choose a partner for life.
08nsvHZLNfE_20-5-rgb_front	3.58	The other thing is find somebody who's going to treat you special.
08nsvHZLNfE_21-5-rgb_front	1.5	Do the little things for you.
08nsvHZLNfE_22-5-rgb_front	1.83	Brig you a cup of coffee in the morning.
08nsvHZLNfE_23-5-rgb_front	1.38	A martini at night.
08nsvHZLNfE_24-5-rgb_front	2.62	Or a beer while you're watching a football game.
08nsvHZLNfE_25-5-rgb_front	2.96	Or rub her shoulder or rub her feet.
08nsvHZLNfE_26-5-rgb_front	1.33	Put gas in her car.
08nsvHZLNfE_27-5-rgb_front	2.04	Make her eel very special.
08nsvHZLNfE_28-5-rgb_front	8.17	The other thing you need to take a look at is is what level of interaction takes place with the family.
08nsvHZLNfE_29_30_31-5-rgb_front	7.79	Can you get along with the family? That's an important, important thing. What are your short term goals, your long term goals?
08nsvHZLNfE_3-5-rgb_front	2.33	Well just how do we choose a partner or life?
08nsvHZLNfE_32-5-rgb_front	1.71	What does your retirement look like?
08nsvHZLNfE_33-5-rgb_front	1.29	Do you want children?
08nsvHZLNfE_34-5-rgb_front	10.79	So you have to be aligned from that view point because if you're not then you're going to, this discongruity is going to create problems for you later on down the road.
08nsvHZLNfE_35-5-rgb_front	2.62	So share the same goals.
08nsvHZLNfE_36-5-rgb_front	8.04	Share the same goals in terms of your life, life style but also you need to take a look at, at cultural aspect.
08nsvHZLNfE_37-5-rgb_front	2.88	Relationship work shops are very helpful here.
08nsvHZLNfE_38-5-rgb_front	2.04	Family Resources puts those on.
08nsvHZLNfE_39-5-rgb_front	4.04	And so this is how we learn how to choose a partner for life.
08nsvHZLNfE_4-5-rgb_front	9.5	Well I wish I could say that it's just as ease as going behind isle 12 in a grocery store but it's, it's not that, that, that easy.
08nsvHZLNfE_40-5-rgb_front	4.46	I'm Joe Cuenco with Family Resources, relationships for life.
08nsvHZLNfE_5-5-rgb_front	3.08	The first thing we really need to do is take a look in the mirror.
08nsvHZLNfE_6-5-rgb_front	6.79	We really need to do an introspective look and say who are we from an inventory perspective.
08nsvHZLNfE_7-5-rgb_front	4.96	What do we want short term, long term and then approach it from there.
08nsvHZLNfE_8-5-rgb_front	13.75	You really need to think about who we'd like to be matched up with long term that's very similar to our short term goals and our long term goals, and who we really are.
08nsvHZLNfE_9-5-rgb_front	2.5	Are you looking to be with a professional?
097l3R1JCFQ_0_1-5-rgb_front	12.83	And we're making Chili Verde. We've got our Chili Verde sitting right there not boiling out of control, it just is cooking, let it be.
097l3R1JCFQ_10-5-rgb_front	6.5	Chop that up, it will melt right on top of there.
097l3R1JCFQ_11-5-rgb_front	2.62	There, we got that.
097l3R1JCFQ_12-5-rgb_front	1.5	Now tortillas.
097l3R1JCFQ_13-5-rgb_front	7.12	Let's get some nice tortillas, at least get some flour ones.
097l3R1JCFQ_14-5-rgb_front	4.42	You can get some that you can, that aren't cooked.
097l3R1JCFQ_15-5-rgb_front	3.62	You just take them, they're already made, and you can cook them yourself.
097l3R1JCFQ_16-5-rgb_front	5.33	I like to do that, but today we've just got some regular flour tortillas.
097l3R1JCFQ_17-5-rgb_front	2.21	We got ten of them.
097l3R1JCFQ_2-5-rgb_front	4.33	OKay, we've got out cabbage, we got our lime on the side here, we got that.
097l3R1JCFQ_3-5-rgb_front	2.0	Now, cheese and tortillas.
097l3R1JCFQ_4-5-rgb_front	14.88	I like to have cheese, alright, and one thing with cheese don't buy fake fake, imitation, processed, nasty crap, OKay?
097l3R1JCFQ_5-5-rgb_front	1.96	Get the good stuff, alright?
097l3R1JCFQ_6-5-rgb_front	2.79	This is life and food is delicious.
097l3R1JCFQ_7-5-rgb_front	2.38	So, get this, you can grate it.
097l3R1JCFQ_8-5-rgb_front	4.92	I like to chop it up into thick slices.
097l3R1JCFQ_9-5-rgb_front	2.08	Well, not too thick just thick enough.
09B_3NBFoM8_0-5-rgb_front	7.75	Pain is one of those things that we see a lot of patients for as an acupuncturist and its probably what its best known for.
09B_3NBFoM8_1-5-rgb_front	4.92	Its funny, I sometimes I get a phone call, how much do you charge for elbow pain?
09B_3NBFoM8_10-5-rgb_front	2.79	We may ask some more interesting questions.
09B_3NBFoM8_11-5-rgb_front	22.12	We might say, where on your arm exactly does it hurt, because we have those lines of energy that run along the arms and legs in the body and so depending on exactly where your pain is in a particular place of your arm may guide us towards a particular organ or a particular area.
09B_3NBFoM8_12-5-rgb_front	4.92	Then there's things like is it better with massage or worse than massage?
09B_3NBFoM8_13-5-rgb_front	2.88	Is there a color associated with that pain?
09B_3NBFoM8_14-5-rgb_front	14.67	So all of these are the types of questions your practitioner should be asking you and if you can give them good feedback on that, you'll get the best, fastest treatment to alleviate you of any pains that you may have.
09B_3NBFoM8_2-5-rgb_front	7.79	And what's important in Chinese medicine is to know that everything is done through diagnostics.
09B_3NBFoM8_3_4-5-rgb_front	7.83	So whilst most people would just think, ehh my knee hurts, my back hurts, fix it. There's much more to it than that.
09B_3NBFoM8_5-5-rgb_front	12.79	Some of the more important questions we ask in order to do good diagnostics on what type of pain and what's the best treatment approach are things like what makes it better or worse.
