2751812.mp4,There's something strange about myself.,Neutral
98592049.mp4,I never lived in a house...,Neutral
98857459.mp4,I was born in Florida.,Neutral
98881709.mp4,I lived there in a house with my parents and two brothers...,Neutral
98895873.mp4,... while I was growing up until I was six  and a half years old.,Neutral
99038142.mp4,My family decided to move to Vermont because my father got a job transfer with IBM.,Neutral
99065608.mp4,"We were okay with it, so that`s when my family moved there.",Neutral
99084529.mp4,I grew up there between the age of six and a half and thirteen.,Neutral
99164108.mp4,"Still when I was twelve and a half years old, after six and a half years in all, my father found out that he would have to move away again",Neutral
99210571.mp4,"Because his job involved a big project located south, in New York.",Neutral
76719526.mp4,"So, it wasn't worth it for him to commute frequently for a long distance, it was better for the family to move away.",Neutral
99305816.mp4,"So, we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to New York; it was around an hour north of NYC.",Neutral
99370717.mp4,"But, you might wonder how I managed, with moving frequently, well I was home schooled.",Positive
99395897.mp4,so I didn`t need to worry about attending a hearing school or a Deaf school.,Negative
99454786.mp4,"My mother taught my two brothers and me, so it was easier for us to move around.",Positive
99499600.mp4,So we moved south to New York,Neutral
99523150.mp4,That went on for around six years.,Neutral
99571136.mp4,"I guess I should`ve been moving away again, but my parents were okay with the same job.",Neutral
99639413.mp4,"So, may seem like I stayed there longer than seven years.    But then it hit me...",Neutral
83323313.mp4,I decided I wanted to transfer  to the Rochester Institute.,Neutral
83360967.mp4,"I wanted to be involved in sports and after-school activities, plus many other things. I wanted to be more socialized. So,",Neutral
83444920.mp4,"My parents were alright with it. I transferred to RSD, I stayed in the dorm.",Neutral
83470674.mp4,"So basically, I almost never went home to except for vacations or long weekends, that`s when I would commute. But, most of the time I stayed in Rochester...",Neutral
83507101.mp4,"... for two years, when I was a junior and then a senior in high school. After I graduated from high school, I went to R.I.T., Rochester Institute of Technology.",Neutral
83537939.mp4,"I moved into the dorm again. During that time, my parents had been living where they were for more than seven years, but I had already left home before that.",Neutral
83594638.mp4,When I was nearly all done with RIT. after about my third year. my father sensed that he had pretty much had it with IBM; he wanted to retire and change his career.,Positive
83719008.mp4,"So, the family in fact move here, and I took the opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new house in Rochester.",Positive
83757971.mp4,"Since then, I have lived there for around almost three years.",Neutral
83875522.mp4,"I graduated recently, so that`s means I`ll be looking for a job, probably I`ll move away, so I won't have lived there for seven years.   Now, I`m wondering from now on with the new job does that mean I might be moving around again for the next seven years or less?   So I`m wondering, let`s see, oh well.",Neutral
25317.mp4,I will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is Deaf.,Neutral
25339.mp4,"I will list some. For example, the power of language in hospitals.",Neutral
253410.mp4,"Not just in the hospitals, but in general.",Neutral
253411.mp4,There is one interesting study. What the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident.,Neutral
253512.mp4,Then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions.,Neutral
253613.mp4,"For example, they used different words for each group while asking them the questions.",Neutral
253714.mp4,One group would use the word HIT; other group uses SMASHED; and another group uses COLLIDED. I think there are four or five different words/groups.,Neutral
254018.mp4,"Similarly, the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other.",Neutral
255439.mp4,"So, for the HIT group, they asked them how fast were the cars going before they HIT?",Neutral
255540.mp4,Ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they COLLIDED.,Neutral
254019.mp4,The study notices how the HIT group thinks that the glass wasn't broken at all.,Positive
255641.mp4,"The car was going around 20 mph when it smashed. The SMASHED group said they think the car's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph. But, actually, the glass wasn't broken at all.",Neutral
254120.mp4,Car was going only twenty to thirty MPH. It shows how the language influences individuals' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip.,Neutral
254221.mp4,That's how powerful the language is.,Positive
254222.mp4,"We will be talking about early intervention now. When parents gives a birth to a baby, the baby would go to a hearing screening.",Neutral
254323.mp4,The screening shows that the baby is deaf.,Neutral
254626.mp4,Then they would refer the parents to the early intervention professionals.,Neutral
254627.mp4,"The meeting will include a specialist, audiologist, doctor, nurse, counselor, and social worker. There are seven specialists for only two parents. Wow.",Positive
255742.mp4,"While for the deaf babies, they are not any of them.",Neutral
254830.mp4,Now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention. But the word makes it seems like they are intervening.,Positive
255032.mp4,It seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child.,Neutral
255134.mp4,"Why don't we use ""early involvement"", which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together; and not intervening them.",Positive
255235.mp4,"Thirdly, the hospital often will discuss about the communication options.",Neutral
255236.mp4,"It seems that parents must choose one between oralism, cochlear implant, sign language or cued-speech. They can't pick all of the options.",Neutral
255337.mp4,"They really can do all of the options. One family can choose to use sign language, and if another family wants to use speech, that's fine.",Neutral
255743.mp4,It's important that the child signs. Hospitals don't use 'communication opportunities' as their word choices.,Neutral
255945.mp4,"The doctors often would say ""We should discuss the grief progress. Here's the social worker and counselor, they will help you to nagivate the grief progress.""",Neutral
256047.mp4,Why don't we discuss it as the journey through experience?,Neutral
256148.mp4,It would turn into a positive thing.,Positive
256149.mp4,Often in the meeting; all people in the room are hearing except for the baby.,Neutral
256250.mp4,We should bring in the Deaf mentor to meet the parents.,Neutral
256453.mp4,"The parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly. Without a Deaf role model, we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the Deaf person.",Neutral
256554.mp4,The researches have proven that a child with a Deaf mentor often perform better. There is a research that studies two groups from Utah and Tennessee.,Positive
256555.mp4,The early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist.,Neutral
256656.mp4,Both locations had the same number of meetings; same occurences of home visits; same kind of school; and the same resources.,Neutral
256657.mp4,"Except for Utah group, the child had a Deaf mentor, while the group from Tennessee did not.",Neutral
256758.mp4,"The study noticed that the Deaf child from Utah resulted in better social, emotion and cognitive developments.",Positive
256859.mp4,It makes sense because the parents will learn from the Deaf mentor after including him/her in the family. The parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the Deaf community.,Neutral
256860.mp4,Parents cannot simply rely on a Deaf mentor. They must do more such as being involved in the Deaf community.,Neutral
256961.mp4,Be friends with their child's friend's parents. It's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others.,Positive
257062.mp4,There is another research in Australia with the similar idea.,Neutral
257063.mp4,"There are two groups with same guidelines. One group has Deaf professionals being involved, while another group did not.",Neutral
257164.mp4,The parents of the group with Deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly.,Neutral
257266.mp4,"So, the family must have a Deaf role model supporting them.",Positive
257367.mp4,"Therefore, overall, there's a missing link. If we change that, it will influence the deaf children to develop better.",Neutral

745928.mp4,I just arrived now.,Neutral

53900308.mp4,So those experiences already have a set meaning especially for the deaf.,Neutral
53931043.mp4,There are many implications associated with deaf experiences and trying to make accommodations. Often people will hear a deaf person and criticize them and think there's something wrong until they find out the person is deaf and then the situation is excused.

46361389.mp4,There are many different experiences reported by various testimonies.,Neutral
46495880.mp4,It shows us how hard it is for us to handle the voice range since the expectations are already culturally settled on what is acceptable and what is not.,Neutral

-9nBmSvp2Co_0-8-rgb_front,"Mascara brushes are sold at drug stores or your beauty supply store and they do come in different sizes, like I said, and it is best to change your mascara brush because it tends to build up bacteria and to clump.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_1-8-rgb_front,"The best way to prevent clumping is to actually take your mascara brush, and if you do see any clumps on your brush, is to wipe it off on a napkin or a paper towel that won't leave any residue behind.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_10-8-rgb_front,"It's best not to take your mascara brush and wipe the excess off on the lid of the bottle because that just rubs right back in and that's what causes the clumping, and then you'll have the clumps left over on your eyelashes.",Positive

-9nBmSvp2Co_18-8-rgb_front,These type of stoves give you a little more latitude of what kind of fuel you can get for them.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_2-8-rgb_front,If you have any questions on these types of stoves give your outfitter a holler.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_3-8-rgb_front,So the next step in making your clays is going to be to sieve the mixture.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_4-8-rgb_front,"Now I've got one of these large fancy sieves, it's got brushes on the bottom and it turns, and then it comes with screens at different meshes, this one is 80 mesh",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_5-8-rgb_front,"Anywhere from about 80 to 100 is appropriate for most glazes, a 50 might not be fine enough, and you don't want to go too much thinner than a 100, because some of your materials might not be small enough to go through.",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_6-8-rgb_front,"So you're going to mix, just stir up again, feel the bottom, you want to have a large spoon.",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_7-8-rgb_front,Make sure that there's no big chunks kind of laying in weight down there.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_8-8-rgb_front,"And then you'll take a pitcher, and get a scoop, poor it right into your sieve.",Negative
-9nBmSvp2Co_9-8-rgb_front,"And then with this one you just turn the brushes, and that pushes the material through the screen.",Neutral
-9umTJVGSqk_4-8-rgb_front,"If you don't have a big fancy one like this with the brushes, a lot of times wear a rubber clove and just kind of use your hand to work the materials through the screen that works also.",Positive

-c5CKp2JWHE_6-5-rgb_front,"Now there are other options if you're having trouble getting the adhesive tile off the floor, you can actually soak a rag in solvent and drape the rag over the top of the floor and cover it with plastic to keep the fumes from getting out and that will actually work on dissolving that glue underneath and may make it a little bit easier for you to get that piece out.",Neutral

01m9yM04RwY_8-3-rgb_front,So the first thing I need to do is prepare the clay for the extruder.,Neutral
01m9yM04RwY_9-3-rgb_front,"Now my extruder has a 4 inch cylindrical barrel, so I need to get a piece of clay that's going to fit in there nicely.",Positive
01okYWMvD-0_0-3-rgb_front,So I'm going to cut a piece off.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_1-3-rgb_front,"And then I'm going to pound it on the table, to round out the corners.",Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_2-3-rgb_front,And then I'm going to pat to elongate it and thin it out just a little bit more.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_3-3-rgb_front,Now I want it to be smaller than the actual size of the barrel of the extruder itself so that it will slip in there really easily and it won't get jammed or anything like that.,Positive
01okYWMvD-0_4-3-rgb_front,So now the clay is prepared and I'll show you over at the extruder how this works.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_5-3-rgb_front,Hi my name is Lauren and today I am here to discuss how to brush your hair.,Neutral

01ucR6XreJw_11-5-rgb_front,It also increases the blood circulation to your brain which nourishes your papilla.,Neutral
01ucR6XreJw_12-5-rgb_front,"Once the blood circulation actually increases towards your brain and towards your scalp your nutrients, your papilla which is where the base of your hair follicle is going to grab nutrients out of your bloodstream and help nourish your hair so it is a very good thing to be in the habit of brushing your hair on a regular basis.",Positive
01ucR6XreJw_13-5-rgb_front,The easiest way to brush your hair especially if your hair is rather knotted is to start at the bottom of the end of the shaft and work your way up.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_3-5-rgb_front,If you use a Boar's Head bristle then it will also help promote smoothness in your hair and it will help maintain frizz.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_4-5-rgb_front,Plastic bristles will also help get all of those knots out because it has a bit of a better grab to it.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_5-5-rgb_front,So again you are going to start at the end of your hair shaft and you are going to work your way up towards your root.,Neutral
01ucR6XreJw_6-5-rgb_front,Once you get towards your root you can then do a few really good brush strokes in order to increase that circulation and have more blood flow go up to your scalp and that is how to brush your hair.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_7-5-rgb_front,In this next clip we're going to be going over a hook kick. Ok. A hook is a very powerful kick.,Positive

025gAKRCIKY_0_1-3-rgb_front,The whole foot is going to be pointed straight and I'm going to hook that all the way across. Ok. That's our kicking position.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_10-3-rgb_front,So again from here.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_11-3-rgb_front,And that is going to be your skip hook kick.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_12-3-rgb_front,It is the opposite of a round kick.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_2-3-rgb_front,"O.k., I'm Bobby Larew.",Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_3-3-rgb_front,One of the drills you can do to work on your front entries is just called a line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_4-3-rgb_front,I should go in vertical and I should be working on my pike save at the end.,Positive
025gAKRCIKY_5-3-rgb_front,So I'm going to go walk up to the 3 meter and do a front line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_6-3-rgb_front,"A line up I'm going to do on the 3 meter board, o.k.",Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_7-3-rgb_front,I do that because it gives me enough height and I don't have to worry about doing a good hurdle to practice a line up.,Positive
025gAKRCIKY_8-3-rgb_front,You can solely concentrate on the line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_9-3-rgb_front,"A good line up I'm going to go to the end of the board feet together, I'm going to bend at the waste and extend my arms.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_1-8-rgb_front,"What I'm concentrating on is making sure I get my hands closed above my head, make sure my elbows are locked, my biceps are squeezing my head and my ears.",Positive
028cpYJmYAk_10-8-rgb_front,Make sure I have no arch like I'm sucking my back this way,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_2-8-rgb_front,"I want to have nice tight legs, thighs spread apart",Positive
028cpYJmYAk_4-8-rgb_front,I shouldn't get a lot of splash.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_5-8-rgb_front,"We actually used the sewing machine for this, and basically we had two pieces of fabric.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_6-8-rgb_front,I'm just going to get my little cloth and just dampen it up a little bit.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_7-8-rgb_front,And then we're going to put that on there.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_8-8-rgb_front,"Again, make sure none of the fusing is actually sticking out, because if it gets on your iron board, it's really sticky and it gets on your iron and it's impossible to get out.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_9-8-rgb_front,"Like that, put that down, see how it steams, and it's sealing it shut for us right now.",Positive

02CpakICRL4_5-8-rgb_front,"Stick around, I'm going to show you a few tricks for embellishing before we go.",Neutral
02CpakICRL4_6-8-rgb_front,"We used the zigzag stitch around, and turn it right side out, and we actually have a little spot that we're going to slip-stitch but I had an epiphany as I was ironing, because you are going to want to just iron your placemat so all of your edges are nice and flat.",Positive
02CpakICRL4_7-8-rgb_front,"Go around and we're not going to actually slip-stitch, we are going to use our fusible tape to finish this placemat.",Neutral
02CpakICRL4_8-8-rgb_front,"So I'm just going to measure, it's a very, very little area, very small area that I need to finish here.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_0-8-rgb_front,"So you just measure and cut, and again be sure you measure the exact length because if you go over and it ends up sticking out and the iron gets on it, it's going to get really hot and it's going to make the outside of your fabric really sticky and that's going to start to bunch up and you don't want that.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_1-8-rgb_front,So really kind of take your time in measuring how much tape you?re going to use.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_10-8-rgb_front,"Just fold your fabric under on both sides like that, you just tuck it in, use your finger to do the corner.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_11-8-rgb_front,"Lay that down, but make sure your tape does go all the way to the corner, otherwise you're going to have a little open corner and you don't want that either.",Positive

02LnULLXds4_17-8-rgb_front,The king is thirteen by himself.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_18-8-rgb_front,"So aces are worth one, twos are worth two, three is three",Positive

02LnULLXds4_2-8-rgb_front,"Well the cards I have dealt at the start of this hand of baroness are an ace, a two, a ten, a ten, and a three.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_20-8-rgb_front,"So, if I want combinations that add up to thirteen, at this point all I have are a three plus one of the tens.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_21-8-rgb_front,So I'm going to take down this three and this ten.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_22-8-rgb_front,That adds up to thirteen.,Neutral

02LnULLXds4_30-8-rgb_front,"If you're doing more Tribal Fusion, or if you're doing more Improvisational Tribal Style.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_31-8-rgb_front,"So, it depends on where your arms are supposed to go, but ultimately, you want your isolations to remain nice and precise.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_32-8-rgb_front,"So, that you get nice clean movements out of your dancing.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_4-8-rgb_front,I'm Johanna Krynytzky from Hip Expressions Belly Dance Studio helping you to practice your Tribal belly dance.,Neutral

02LnULLXds4_7-8-rgb_front,"Alright, you have Improvisational Tribal style which developed out of San Francisco in the 1980s and that's where you dance with a group working on cues and improvisations.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_8-8-rgb_front,"In that case, what you needed to do to practice is to practice with your group.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_9-8-rgb_front,There are certain moves that you need to practice over and over and over again until you have them precisely correct.,Neutral

02M-Xcs3X30_1-3-rgb_front,"So, depending on what you're practicing, everything comes back to having your basic isolations.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_2-3-rgb_front,"So, you want to practice in front of a mirror with your partners, or if you're doing solo, by yourself, making sure your feet are together, under your hips, your knees are bent.",Positive
02M-Xcs3X30_3-3-rgb_front,This is a lead weight welded to an alligator clip.,Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_4-3-rgb_front,"We want to hook that to the snell on the hook and drop it down the hole, laying out our line until such time that we get slack.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_5-3-rgb_front,"When we have slack, we know we're on the bottom. There's our slack. We want to mark that and pull it up.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_6-3-rgb_front,Then we know exactly how much line to reel in so that we know that our bait is just off of the bottom.,Neutral

02QGTJlJYnM_14-8-rgb_front,"Now, if we were to take an infielder's glove, you'd take a couple of inches off of the end of this glove right here.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_15-8-rgb_front,An infielder's glove is much smaller.,Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_16-8-rgb_front,"It's because they're used to field the ball on the ground, so you want less size.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_17-8-rgb_front,"In the outfield, you need a bigger pocket, a little bit thicker.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_18-8-rgb_front,"Now, the first baseman's glove is the exact opposite.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_19-8-rgb_front,It's larger than your standard outfielder's glove.,Neutral

02WRxAwx-Bo_24-8-rgb_front,"The other thing you want to do is also, your response may differ, whether you're, what we call an internal directed person, perhaps you think about it a lot, you're going to, you're going to internalize it, you're not going to speak to your friends, you're just kind of go and go quiet walks on the beach, process that information by yourself.",Positive

06St8W_JHok_3-5-rgb_front,"Another really important tool and a kind of a must-have tool is your clippers obviously for clipping the line, if you add and tip it or you got a knot and you need to cut your leader to retie it, you want to have clippers.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_4-5-rgb_front,Another thing that's important on your clippers is this little needle.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_5-5-rgb_front,This one actually has a retractable needle.,Neutral

06Yvm4X81WI_13-5-rgb_front,"You push down, into the center a little bit, with that fist that you've made and once you've made the well here, you want to check the depth, with your needle tool.",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_14-5-rgb_front,"For a berry bowl, you probably want, that's about an inch and that's probably about right because we're going to have a trimmed foot on there, so you need to leave room for that.",Neutral

06Yvm4X81WI_5-5-rgb_front,"So, it's perfectly fine to keep that ankle bent up to whatever angle you need to in order to maintain this position.",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_6-5-rgb_front,"The ankle is not necessarily important, it's keeping the body sunk down over the leg, which is important, wherever your ankle manages to be in that position is fine.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_7-5-rgb_front,"That being said, the more you can draw your heel down to the floor and sink forward, the more you're going to be gaining flexibility in the ankle and that's going to help your martial arts training, especially when we're doing kicks and using darthaflexion and Plantar flexion for thrusting forward",Positive

06jk1stVwMI_22-5-rgb_front,"They come in a variety of sizes and, of course, they're available at your local stained glass store.",Neutral

06jk1stVwMI_24-5-rgb_front,"In fact, they turn out to be quite cheap at that point.",Neutral

06k75HRlfqc_10-8-rgb_front,And I'm going to talk about how to prepare the platform statement that you're going to turn into the judges so that they can read this about you and determine whether or not your platform is strong enough to support your pageant title.,Positive

06tA1xvaSt8_0-5-rgb_front,"If you over mix it, your cookies will run.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_1-5-rgb_front,"If you over mix your muffin, your muffin will run because what happens is, you will incorporate so much air in it, that the air, in there, will bubble up and make the cookie and the muffin, run.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_10-5-rgb_front,"Now, what is a window?",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_11-5-rgb_front,Let me show you what a window is.,Neutral

077IIb5uuCs_13-5-rgb_front,"It's hard, it's going to hurt, but you're done.",Negative

077IIb5uuCs_4-5-rgb_front,"At the end of that 10 times, you can just noodle home, take an easy ride to recover.",Positive
077IIb5uuCs_5-5-rgb_front,But it's those really hard efforts and it can be short.,Neutral

077IIb5uuCs_8-5-rgb_front,"And the other thing I would add for training for road racing is do a little bit of that base miles training where you're at 75%, 80%, 90% of your max for an extended period of time, and maybe you're doing that on your Wednesday.",Neutral

077rQK39ycg_4-5-rgb_front,"But basically what this looks like is, once you're sitting on your ball, the sit bones, you're bringing your arms overhead, you're going to shrug your shoulders towards your ears with that inhalation, and then as you exhale, you're going to press down.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_5-5-rgb_front,"And if you notice, I'm not bending my elbows.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_6-5-rgb_front,"It's not about this, it's about the shoulder moves.",Neutral
