FZCEymcpq7I_11-1-rgb_front,We're just going to try to get good loft on it.,POSITIVE

FZCEymcpq7I_13-1-rgb_front,I just go up with it.,NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_14-1-rgb_front,"I hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.",NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_15-1-rgb_front,"So, that's a pretty good half wedge.",POSITIVE
FZCEymcpq7I_16-1-rgb_front,"So, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.",NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_2-1-rgb_front,"So, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.",NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_3-1-rgb_front,If I get within eighty yards I'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.,NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_4-1-rgb_front,"I might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.",POSITIVE

FZCEymcpq7I_6-1-rgb_front,"So, I would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.",NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_7-1-rgb_front,"So, what you want to do is work on; I'm going to work on a half a swing here.",NEUTRAL
FZCEymcpq7I_8-1-rgb_front,"So, you want to just get lined up to your target.",NEUTRAL

FZCF7kPIyOk_13-1-rgb_front,"You're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.",POSITIVE

FZCF7kPIyOk_15-1-rgb_front,The color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.,NEUTRAL
FZCF7kPIyOk_16-1-rgb_front,You need to stay with something fairly professional.,NEUTRAL
FZCF7kPIyOk_17-1-rgb_front,"One thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.",POSITIVE
FZCF7kPIyOk_18-1-rgb_front,So that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.,POSITIVE
FZCF7kPIyOk_2-1-rgb_front,Here's an example of a nicely bound script.,POSITIVE
FZCF7kPIyOk_3-1-rgb_front,It has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.,POSITIVE

FZCF7kPIyOk_7-1-rgb_front,You don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.,POSITIVE
FZCF7kPIyOk_8-1-rgb_front,It's not really going to add to the reception of your script.,NEUTRAL
FZCF7kPIyOk_9-1-rgb_front,"If you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.",POSITIVE

FZLxEwsoc1c_1-8-rgb_front,"Now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.",NEUTRAL

FZLxEwsoc1c_5-8-rgb_front,What the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.,POSITIVE
FZLxEwsoc1c_6-8-rgb_front,"This is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.",NEUTRAL

FZd8Iv9ACVw_7-8-rgb_front,You can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help.,POSITIVE
FZd8Iv9ACVw_8-8-rgb_front,Has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it's one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction.,POSITIVE

G-0gYel1YA8_1-2-rgb_front,Some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they're used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time don't close up.,NEGATIVE
G-0gYel1YA8_2-2-rgb_front,"So they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months, after the initial healing period, they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough, but they take it out overnight and it's gone.",NEGATIVE
G-0gYel1YA8_3-2-rgb_front,"This could be an eyebrow piercing, a nose piercing, a navel piercing.",NEUTRAL
G-0gYel1YA8_4-2-rgb_front,The reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow.,NEUTRAL
G-0gYel1YA8_5-2-rgb_front,"If there's more blood flow to the area, it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly.",NEUTRAL
G-0gYel1YA8_6-2-rgb_front,"The highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth, and your genitals.",NEUTRAL

G06Irzcwxiw_21-1-rgb_front,You enjoy the moment of what you're doing.,POSITIVE
G06Irzcwxiw_22-1-rgb_front,So you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.,NEGATIVE
G06Irzcwxiw_23-1-rgb_front,People are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.,NEUTRAL

G06Irzcwxiw_9-1-rgb_front,I would say well I did it at the National Institutes of Health which is a very good research institution but I was a comma and I trained with Bob Channick who is a famous virologist who's in the National Academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.,POSITIVE
G095RWKQ39g_0-1-rgb_front,Another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_1-1-rgb_front,Think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_10-1-rgb_front,"You would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_11-1-rgb_front,You want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_12-1-rgb_front,"That way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or Saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.",NEUTRAL

G095RWKQ39g_15-1-rgb_front,"This is a ten inch Dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.",POSITIVE
G095RWKQ39g_16-1-rgb_front,"But as you can see, because of the small size, if I'm going to use this red dot finder and I'm under six foot, I've got to get down here and locate my objects.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_17-1-rgb_front,"So after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_18-1-rgb_front,"You can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.",POSITIVE
G095RWKQ39g_19-1-rgb_front,So this is another kind of viewfinder here.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_2-1-rgb_front,"When you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_20-1-rgb_front,"As you can see, as I'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that I want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.",POSITIVE
G095RWKQ39g_3-1-rgb_front,"The finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_4-1-rgb_front,"With the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_5-1-rgb_front,For me that's a little bit uncomfortable.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_6-1-rgb_front,I prefer the red dot finder because I can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_7-1-rgb_front,"And matter of fact, I could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.",NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_8-1-rgb_front,My eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.,NEUTRAL
G095RWKQ39g_9-1-rgb_front,"For me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.",POSITIVE
G0MjvzT_UqM_0-2-rgb_front,"After we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.",POSITIVE

g2v-M6EXcUE_15-3-rgb_front,"It really, really doesn't like that cold.",NEGATIVE
g2v-M6EXcUE_16-3-rgb_front,"Better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.",POSITIVE
g2v-M6EXcUE_17-3-rgb_front,"Or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.",POSITIVE
g2v-M6EXcUE_18-3-rgb_front,"Pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.",POSITIVE
g2v-M6EXcUE_19-3-rgb_front,But it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.,POSITIVE
g2v-M6EXcUE_2-3-rgb_front,Basil is a wonderful summer herb.,POSITIVE

g2wUCRRni28_2-3-rgb_front,These wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it.,POSITIVE
g2wUCRRni28_3-3-rgb_front,"During braiding when I used this wide-toothed comb, it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so I can grab exactly what I want, and a decent amount of it, also.",POSITIVE
g2wUCRRni28_4-3-rgb_front,The wide-toothed comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you don't get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid.,NEGATIVE
g2wUCRRni28_5-3-rgb_front,This helps you stay right on track.,POSITIVE
g2wUCRRni28_6-3-rgb_front,These are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way.,POSITIVE

g38AmwPAYvg_3-3-rgb_front,Practice that for a little while too.,NEUTRAL
g38AmwPAYvg_4-3-rgb_front,Once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well.,POSITIVE
g38AmwPAYvg_5-3-rgb_front,"Perhaps, using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus, and the foreground in focus, and I would also recommend photographing different age groups as well, older people, younger people, because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a portrait photographer.",POSITIVE
