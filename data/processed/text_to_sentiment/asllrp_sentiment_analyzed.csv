25317.mp4,I will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is Deaf.,NEUTRAL
25328.mp4,There are so many things that are wrong with the system.,NEGATIVE
25339.mp4,"I will list some. For example, the power of language in hospitals.",NEUTRAL
253410.mp4,"Not just in the hospitals, but in general.",NEUTRAL
253411.mp4,There is one interesting study. What the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident.,NEUTRAL
253512.mp4,Then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions.,NEUTRAL
253613.mp4,"For example, they used different words for each group while asking them the questions.",NEUTRAL
253714.mp4,One group would use the word HIT; other group uses SMASHED; and another group uses COLLIDED. I think there are four or five different words/groups.,NEUTRAL
253715.mp4,Then they would ask the HIT group about the car and whether if the glass was broken.,NEGATIVE
255438.mp4,Or they will ask another group SMASHED about the car and whether if the glass was broken.,NEGATIVE
253816.mp4,Or ask the COLLIDED group about the car and if the glass was broken?,NEGATIVE
253917.mp4,"Ask another group, the CRASHED group about the car and whether if the glass is broken.",NEGATIVE
254018.mp4,"Similarly, the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other.",NEUTRAL
255439.mp4,"So, for the HIT group, they asked them how fast were the cars going before they HIT?",NEUTRAL
255540.mp4,Ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they COLLIDED.,NEUTRAL
254019.mp4,The study notices how the HIT group thinks that the glass wasn't broken at all.,POSITIVE
255641.mp4,"The car was going around 20 mph when it smashed. The SMASHED group said they think the car's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph. But, actually, the glass wasn't broken at all.",NEUTRAL
254120.mp4,Car was going only twenty to thirty MPH. It shows how the language influences individuals' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip.,NEUTRAL
254221.mp4,That's how powerful the language is.,POSITIVE
254222.mp4,"We will be talking about early intervention now. When parents gives a birth to a baby, the baby would go to a hearing screening.",NEUTRAL
254323.mp4,The screening shows that the baby is deaf.,NEUTRAL
254424.mp4,"The first thing the doctor and nurse would say to the parents would be ""I am sorry."" It's an automatic negative. ""I am sorry that your child is Deaf"".",NEGATIVE

254829.mp4,"Why don't they use a word like ""identified"" as in ""I've identified this child deaf""? Now it does not seem bad at all.",POSITIVE
254830.mp4,Now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention. But the word makes it seems like they are intervening.,POSITIVE
254931.mp4,"""Intervention"" implies the need of intervening such as an intervention for drug addicts, stopping something from happening, or when a kid is not behaving well.",NEGATIVE
255032.mp4,It seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child.,NEUTRAL
255033.mp4,"The baby is just deaf. It's not their fault, they're doing perfectly fine.",POSITIVE
255134.mp4,"Why don't we use ""early involvement"", which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together; and not intervening them.",POSITIVE
255235.mp4,"Thirdly, the hospital often will discuss about the communication options.",NEUTRAL
255236.mp4,"It seems that parents must choose one between oralism, cochlear implant, sign language or cued-speech. They can't pick all of the options.",NEUTRAL
255337.mp4,"They really can do all of the options. One family can choose to use sign language, and if another family wants to use speech, that's fine.",NEUTRAL
255743.mp4,It's important that the child signs. Hospitals don't use 'communication opportunities' as their word choices.,NEUTRAL
255844.mp4,That makes it to seem like an opportunity to do more than one.,POSITIVE
255945.mp4,"The doctors often would say ""We should discuss the grief progress. Here's the social worker and counselor, they will help you to nagivate the grief progress.""",NEUTRAL

256453.mp4,"The parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly. Without a Deaf role model, we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the Deaf person.",NEUTRAL
256554.mp4,The researches have proven that a child with a Deaf mentor often perform better. There is a research that studies two groups from Utah and Tennessee.,POSITIVE
256555.mp4,The early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist.,NEUTRAL

256758.mp4,"The study noticed that the Deaf child from Utah resulted in better social, emotion and cognitive developments.",POSITIVE
256859.mp4,It makes sense because the parents will learn from the Deaf mentor after including him/her in the family. The parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the Deaf community.,NEUTRAL
256860.mp4,Parents cannot simply rely on a Deaf mentor. They must do more such as being involved in the Deaf community.,NEUTRAL
256961.mp4,Be friends with their child's friend's parents. It's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others.,POSITIVE
257062.mp4,There is another research in Australia with the similar idea.,NEUTRAL
257063.mp4,"There are two groups with same guidelines. One group has Deaf professionals being involved, while another group did not.",NEUTRAL
257164.mp4,The parents of the group with Deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly.,NEUTRAL
257265.mp4,"When a deaf child does not have a Deaf mentor, the family will continue to be disappointed and their grief will last longer.",NEGATIVE
257266.mp4,"So, the family must have a Deaf role model supporting them.",POSITIVE
257367.mp4,"Therefore, overall, there's a missing link. If we change that, it will influence the deaf children to develop better.",NEUTRAL

50743523.mp4,I was like whoa! I didn't know that I was making noises. It's interesting how voices made by Deaf people can give rise to misinterpretation.,POSITIVE

64570450.mp4,"If you were curious and walked by you would see two deaf professionals, one a teacher and the other a manager. They were discussing politics and having a deep dialogue and the signing was so in depth. But the grunt sound and the vocals sounded like an animal fight.",NEUTRAL

64659589.mp4,"That kind of sound has a different meaning. What happens in situations with grants is that there can be many different cultural situations where there are uncontrollable voices, voice excess or grunts, and it's not acceptable. It really blocks your communication process.",NEGATIVE

53869368.mp4,"People can't imagine how, if a person who can't control his voice, how he would run the country. So automatically people can't accept him as president just by his voice. That is an example of excessive voice in comparison to grunts.",NEUTRAL
53900308.mp4,So those experiences already have a set meaning especially for the deaf.,NEUTRAL
53931043.mp4,There are many implications associated with deaf experiences and trying to make accommodations. Often people will hear a deaf person and criticize them and think there's something wrong until they find out the person is deaf and then the situation is excused. But there is still that initial rude stare because people aren't making that connection between what they hear and the deaf person.,NEGATIVE

46361389.mp4,There are many different experiences reported by various testimonies.,NEUTRAL
46495880.mp4,It shows us how hard it is for us to handle the voice range since the expectations are already culturally settled on what is acceptable and what is not.,NEUTRAL
