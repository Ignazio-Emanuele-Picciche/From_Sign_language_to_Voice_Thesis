2751812.mp4,There's something strange about myself.,Neutral
98592049.mp4,I never lived in a house...,Neutral
98857459.mp4,I was born in Florida.,Neutral
98881709.mp4,I lived there in a house with my parents and two brothers...,Neutral
98895873.mp4,... while I was growing up until I was six  and a half years old.,Neutral
99038142.mp4,My family decided to move to Vermont because my father got a job transfer with IBM.,Neutral
99065608.mp4,"We were okay with it, so that`s when my family moved there.",Neutral
99084529.mp4,I grew up there between the age of six and a half and thirteen.,Neutral
99164108.mp4,"Still when I was twelve and a half years old, after six and a half years in all, my father found out that he would have to move away again",Neutral
99210571.mp4,"Because his job involved a big project located south, in New York.",Neutral
76719526.mp4,"So, it wasn't worth it for him to commute frequently for a long distance, it was better for the family to move away.",Neutral
99305816.mp4,"So, we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to New York; it was around an hour north of NYC.",Neutral
99370717.mp4,"But, you might wonder how I managed, with moving frequently, well I was home schooled.",Neutral
99395897.mp4,so I didn`t need to worry about attending a hearing school or a Deaf school.,Neutral
99454786.mp4,"My mother taught my two brothers and me, so it was easier for us to move around.",Neutral
99499600.mp4,So we moved south to New York,Neutral
99523150.mp4,That went on for around six years.,Neutral
99571136.mp4,"I guess I should`ve been moving away again, but my parents were okay with the same job.",Neutral
99639413.mp4,"So, may seem like I stayed there longer than seven years.    But then it hit me...",Neutral
83323313.mp4,I decided I wanted to transfer  to the Rochester Institute.,Neutral
83360967.mp4,"I wanted to be involved in sports and after-school activities, plus many other things. I wanted to be more socialized. So,",Neutral
83444920.mp4,"My parents were alright with it. I transferred to RSD, I stayed in the dorm.",Neutral
83470674.mp4,"So basically, I almost never went home to except for vacations or long weekends, that`s when I would commute. But, most of the time I stayed in Rochester...",Neutral
83507101.mp4,"... for two years, when I was a junior and then a senior in high school. After I graduated from high school, I went to R.I.T., Rochester Institute of Technology.",Neutral
83537939.mp4,"I moved into the dorm again. During that time, my parents had been living where they were for more than seven years, but I had already left home before that.",Neutral
83594638.mp4,When I was nearly all done with RIT. after about my third year. my father sensed that he had pretty much had it with IBM; he wanted to retire and change his career.,Neutral
83719008.mp4,"So, the family in fact move here, and I took the opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new house in Rochester.",Neutral
83757971.mp4,"Since then, I have lived there for around almost three years.",Neutral
83875522.mp4,"I graduated recently, so that`s means I`ll be looking for a job, probably I`ll move away, so I won't have lived there for seven years.   Now, I`m wondering from now on with the new job does that mean I might be moving around again for the next seven years or less?   So I`m wondering, let`s see, oh well.",Neutral
25317.mp4,I will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is Deaf.,Neutral
25339.mp4,"I will list some. For example, the power of language in hospitals.",Neutral
253410.mp4,"Not just in the hospitals, but in general.",Neutral
253411.mp4,There is one interesting study. What the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident.,Neutral
253512.mp4,Then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions.,Neutral
253613.mp4,"For example, they used different words for each group while asking them the questions.",Neutral
253714.mp4,One group would use the word HIT; other group uses SMASHED; and another group uses COLLIDED. I think there are four or five different words/groups.,Neutral
254018.mp4,"Similarly, the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other.",Neutral
255439.mp4,"So, for the HIT group, they asked them how fast were the cars going before they HIT?",Neutral
255540.mp4,Ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they COLLIDED.,Neutral
254019.mp4,The study notices how the HIT group thinks that the glass wasn't broken at all.,Neutral
255641.mp4,"The car was going around 20 mph when it smashed. The SMASHED group said they think the car's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph. But, actually, the glass wasn't broken at all.",Neutral
254120.mp4,Car was going only twenty to thirty MPH. It shows how the language influences individuals' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip.,Neutral
254221.mp4,That's how powerful the language is.,Neutral
254222.mp4,"We will be talking about early intervention now. When parents gives a birth to a baby, the baby would go to a hearing screening.",Neutral
254323.mp4,The screening shows that the baby is deaf.,Neutral
254626.mp4,Then they would refer the parents to the early intervention professionals.,Neutral
254627.mp4,"The meeting will include a specialist, audiologist, doctor, nurse, counselor, and social worker. There are seven specialists for only two parents. Wow.",Positive
255742.mp4,"While for the deaf babies, they are not any of them.",Neutral
254830.mp4,Now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention. But the word makes it seems like they are intervening.,Positive
255032.mp4,It seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child.,Neutral
255134.mp4,"Why don't we use ""early involvement"", which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together; and not intervening them.",Neutral
255235.mp4,"Thirdly, the hospital often will discuss about the communication options.",Neutral
255236.mp4,"It seems that parents must choose one between oralism, cochlear implant, sign language or cued-speech. They can't pick all of the options.",Neutral
255337.mp4,"They really can do all of the options. One family can choose to use sign language, and if another family wants to use speech, that's fine.",Neutral
255743.mp4,It's important that the child signs. Hospitals don't use 'communication opportunities' as their word choices.,Neutral
255945.mp4,"The doctors often would say ""We should discuss the grief progress. Here's the social worker and counselor, they will help you to nagivate the grief progress.""",Neutral
256047.mp4,Why don't we discuss it as the journey through experience?,Neutral
256148.mp4,It would turn into a positive thing.,Positive
256149.mp4,Often in the meeting; all people in the room are hearing except for the baby.,Neutral
256250.mp4,We should bring in the Deaf mentor to meet the parents.,Neutral
256453.mp4,"The parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly. Without a Deaf role model, we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the Deaf person.",Neutral
256554.mp4,The researches have proven that a child with a Deaf mentor often perform better. There is a research that studies two groups from Utah and Tennessee.,Neutral
256555.mp4,The early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist.,Neutral
256656.mp4,Both locations had the same number of meetings; same occurences of home visits; same kind of school; and the same resources.,Neutral
256657.mp4,"Except for Utah group, the child had a Deaf mentor, while the group from Tennessee did not.",Neutral
256758.mp4,"The study noticed that the Deaf child from Utah resulted in better social, emotion and cognitive developments.",Neutral
256859.mp4,It makes sense because the parents will learn from the Deaf mentor after including him/her in the family. The parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the Deaf community.,Neutral
256860.mp4,Parents cannot simply rely on a Deaf mentor. They must do more such as being involved in the Deaf community.,Neutral
256961.mp4,Be friends with their child's friend's parents. It's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others.,Positive
257062.mp4,There is another research in Australia with the similar idea.,Neutral
257063.mp4,"There are two groups with same guidelines. One group has Deaf professionals being involved, while another group did not.",Neutral
257164.mp4,The parents of the group with Deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly.,Neutral
257266.mp4,"So, the family must have a Deaf role model supporting them.",Neutral
257367.mp4,"Therefore, overall, there's a missing link. If we change that, it will influence the deaf children to develop better.",Neutral
745937.mp4,Last week John arrived late.,Neutral
745928.mp4,I just arrived now.,Neutral
745929.mp4,I hope John arrives on time next week.,Neutral

50743523.mp4,I was like whoa! I didn't know that I was making noises. It's interesting how voices made by Deaf people can give rise to misinterpretation.,Positive

60141054.mp4,"In the Deaf speech category, there is a range within intelligible and grunts, but what does ""grun,""  really mean within the cultural context?",Neutral
60172913.mp4,The grunt itself is a deep gruntal sound almost like a pig sound in the throat.,Neutral
60265153.mp4,People who grunt tend to be people who work in heavy lifting environments that don't require high working skills. The grunt sound is often associated with that kind of work and that group of people.,Neutral

63931706.mp4,"After working out and playing he went into the locker room to change clothes and next to the room there was a hallway. He heard two deaf people grunting. As if they were having a conversation, and grunting back and forth.",Neutral
64008821.mp4,If a hearing person were to walk by and didn't know what was happening and who was there they probably would have assumed two people were fighting because of the grunting. That kind of sound makes you wonder.,Neutral
64570450.mp4,"If you were curious and walked by you would see two deaf professionals, one a teacher and the other a manager. They were discussing politics and having a deep dialogue and the signing was so in depth. But the grunt sound and the vocals sounded like an animal fight.",Neutral

64659589.mp4,"That kind of sound has a different meaning. What happens in situations with grants is that there can be many different cultural situations where there are uncontrollable voices, voice excess or grunts, and it's not acceptable. It really blocks your communication process.",Negative
65404696.mp4,"For example, in professional tennis, grunts happen very often.",Neutral

52731827.mp4,"Each time they hit the ball, the players grunt, it happens often throughout the game.",Neutral
52912918.mp4,The point is that the international tennis federation recently considered establishing a uniform code of conduct that states grunting is not allowed.,Neutral

53134152.mp4,Wow and it's trickiling down from the international pro level to the local level; there was a 9-year-old girl in Australia who was thrown out of her tennis club...,Positive

53649420.mp4,For example Howard Dean ran for President as a Democrat candidate in the 2004 Iowa Caucus.,Neutral
53748459.mp4,He placed third in the election but was willing to give his speech that he prepared to win the Caucus. So as he was presenting his voice was building up and he started screaming.,Positive
53784331.mp4,The presenter's scream was a little bit over the normal range to the point where people were staring and shocked and wanted him to stop.,Negative

53869368.mp4,"People can't imagine how, if a person who can't control his voice, how he would run the country. So automatically people can't accept him as president just by his voice. That is an example of excessive voice in comparison to grunts.",Neutral
53900308.mp4,So those experiences already have a set meaning especially for the deaf.,Neutral
53931043.mp4,There are many implications associated with deaf experiences and trying to make accommodations. Often people will hear a deaf person and criticize them and think there's something wrong until they find out the person is deaf and then the situation is excused. But there is still that initial rude stare because people aren't making that connection between what they hear and the deaf person.,Negative

Laughing itself is natural. If there's a funny situation you laugh and enjoy laughing, ae you supposed to control it?",Positive
54316179.mp4,Other cultures have controlled laughing. They have their own acceptable range that you shouldn't go beyond. It's good to stay within the range.,Positive

44113112.mp4,The control of sounds has different areas of rules. The place with quiet expectations. The place with permission to be loud.,Neutral
44228720.mp4,"The areas where there is an expectation of quiet are like a library, church, movie theater.",Neutral

44690388.mp4,"The person next to him nudged the Deaf person with an elbow and said  ""Shh""  and pointed out popcorn. The deaf person realized and learned.",Neutral
44880490.mp4,Sometimes Deaf people share and exchange stories about what they have learned about noises. So they will be careful with subsequent situations.,Neutral
45403603.mp4,"When they go to places where noises are permitted, like football and basketball games—the sites where the fans would be yelling to cheer, Deaf people assume that they are free to make noises, so they join them by yelling and cheering.",Positive
45678110.mp4,"But, it's not precisely permitted since those places have their own hearing culture of expectations in the voice range.",Neutral
45728511.mp4,There's a limited voice range. That's Dean's problem: he often goes over that range.,Negative

46272693.mp4,"So it was wow. There are places that loud voices are permitted but you have to experiment enough on the voice range itself. Some areas are quiet, oh.",Neutral
46361389.mp4,There are many different experiences reported by various testimonies.,Neutral
46495880.mp4,It shows us how hard it is for us to handle the voice range since the expectations are already culturally settled on what is acceptable and what is not.,Neutral
46516761.mp4,"Or if someone goes above the acceptable range, then people will look upon that person negatively.",Neutral
