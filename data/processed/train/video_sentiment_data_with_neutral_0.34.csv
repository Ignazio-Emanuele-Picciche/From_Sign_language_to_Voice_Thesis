-08ZGCviCm4_0-5-rgb_front,The dogs typically like to eat them they are flavored so they chew them right up and what this does is it prevents the production of cottin so if a flea jumps on your dog bites your dog and ingest the blood meal then the blood meal would have the chemical ingredients of the sentinel when they lay there eggs they would not be able to produce cottin.,Positive
-08ZGCviCm4_1-5-rgb_front,cottion is the excess scalp of a flea so it doesn't kill the fleas but it prevents them from infesting or reproducing in your home.,Positive

-0BynF9TSNI_5-5-rgb_front,"Generally, I...I will schedule two to three houses a day, and if I get a late start then, you know, of course, that just delays the next job, and then the next job, and then it can be seven or eight at night when I get home.",Neutral
-0BynF9TSNI_6-5-rgb_front,"And one thing that I like...I try not to do is to interfere with my client's family time as well.

-0BynF9TSNI_7-5-rgb_front,"And...and that makes it tough for me, I don't...I don't like to do that at all. So that's probably the hardest part, is, if I don't start my day right.",Neutral

-8uwu59w8QE_5-8-rgb_front,"One thing my father taught me was, if you've got colors that are opposite of the color wheel, and that means if it's a cold color or a hot color meaning red or blue.",Neutral
-8uwu59w8QE_6-8-rgb_front,If you put them together they're going to vibrate against each other and they're going to get your attention and that's the whole point of putting them together is to get your attention.,Neutral

-96cWDhR4hc_0-5-rgb_front,"If you realize that each of those vendors might be paying say a $100 and if you have ten of those vendors that is a $1,000 that your festival has already to work with.",Positive
-96cWDhR4hc_1-5-rgb_front,How many you have will also depend upon your budget and your site and what you can fit in but you need to think in terms of food and non-food vendors being an intricate part of your event.,Positive
-96cWDhR4hc_10-5-rgb_front,"Food vendors are a whole scene onto themselves because of the complications, health requirements, heating requirements and cooling requirements and the need for power that they bring into your festival.",Positive
-96cWDhR4hc_11-5-rgb_front,"Admittedly, my kicks aren't the most fancy or flashy in the world.",Neutral

-9D6kP1TgbY_13-8-rgb_front,I'm using a heavy duty stapler and you want to make sure you test out your stapler on a scrap piece of wood to make sure that you know where the placement of the stapler is going to be because we're on a very narrow strip here and we don't want to miss our mark when we put our stapler in.,Positive
-9D6kP1TgbY_14-8-rgb_front,"Now with these heavy duty staplers, you want to place it and put your hand right here to give downward pressure right here because if you don't the stapler tends to want to jump up and the staple won't go in properly.",Positive
-9D6kP1TgbY_15-8-rgb_front,"Just color up those staples, it makes a big difference.",Neutral
-9D6kP1TgbY_16-8-rgb_front,You don't notice them as much.,Neutral

-9D6kP1TgbY_19-8-rgb_front,We're going to staple all the way down the edge and put those staples fairly close.,Neutral
-9D6kP1TgbY_2-8-rgb_front,"Now, when you're going over the whole section, you're going to need something to rest the stapler on.",Neutral

-9D6kP1TgbY_21-8-rgb_front,"If you don't use that, your stapler is going to go into the hole and it will shoot in the wrong direction.",Negative
-9D6kP1TgbY_22-8-rgb_front,"So, you want to have something to prop up that stapler and we'll go about every half inch all the way down the side trying to keep those staples in a nice even row.",Positive
-9D6kP1TgbY_3-8-rgb_front,"As a finishing touch, you might want to take a permanent marker and color over the staples so they don't stand out as much or you can touch it up with a little paint also.",Neutral
-9D6kP1TgbY_4-8-rgb_front,"And most of those dealers are setup with secondary finance companies that deal strictly with people that have bad credit or non-existent credit as opposed to the bigger dealerships, the big chains, the big Ford dealerships or the big Chevrolet dealerships.",Neutral

-9GV_-VRpt8_7-8-rgb_front,Blend everything.,Neutral
-9GV_-VRpt8_8-8-rgb_front,"What this does is it takes away the excess powder, blends everything in, and also you shape your brow at that point to your desired shape.",Neutral
-9GV_-VRpt8_9-8-rgb_front,Look how perfect that brow looks.,Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_0-8-rgb_front,Her brows are pretty light.,Positive

-9Kic0QsCYs_12-8-rgb_front,You can use a pencil.,Neutral
-9Kic0QsCYs_13-8-rgb_front,It's all personal preference.,Neutral
-9Kic0QsCYs_14-8-rgb_front,I'm just going to fill in her natural brow line.,Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_15-8-rgb_front,"Hi, this is Sean Hobson and what we're talking about right now is using the proper mechanics to become not only a good shooter, but a good shooter from the free throw line.",Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_2-8-rgb_front,So the last step that we have is to finish out your free throw.,Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_4-8-rgb_front,"What we see a lot of players do is they'll follow through, but then they'll pull their hand back and again, that's going to pull that basketball back a little bit and not let it go ahead and follow through the proper way.",Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_5-8-rgb_front,The last thing is we don't want to fall take our shot and fall back off the free throw line.,Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_6-8-rgb_front,"If you shoot and you take a step back, it?s called negative energy.",Negative
-9Kic0QsCYs_7-8-rgb_front,You're taking energy away from that basketball and not allowing it to go on down.,Neutral
-9Kic0QsCYs_8-8-rgb_front,"So, remember when making a good free throw shot, its not just the shot, its also how you finish after the free throw that's going to make you a good free throw shooter.",Positive
-9Kic0QsCYs_9-8-rgb_front,If Kyle steps up to the line right here and gets himself ready.,Positive
-9KqRMBAAsA_1_2-3-rgb_front,"What we're going to talk about is you have a good base, you have a good foundation.",Positive
-9KqRMBAAsA_3-3-rgb_front,You're going to make the shot,Neutral
-9KqRMBAAsA_4-3-rgb_front,That's the first thing in finishing.,Neutral
-9KqRMBAAsA_5-3-rgb_front,"But the most important thing is by using your legs, a lot of time you see players come up and shoot their free throw and they stay flat footed and then end up hitting the ball on the front of the rim.",Positive
-9KqRMBAAsA_6-3-rgb_front,"What we always want to do is you always want to finish your free throw up on your toes because what that does is when you get up on your toes, that's using the bottom of your leg muscles and its giving you just that extra edge to get that ball up and over the rim.",Positive
-9KqRMBAAsA_7-3-rgb_front,The other thing you want to make sure and do is always follow through and end up out in front of you.,Positive
-9KqRMBAAsA_8-3-rgb_front,You never want to end up with the ball up here.,Neutral
-9KqRMBAAsA_9-3-rgb_front,ALLEN DIWAN: Hi.,Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_1-8-rgb_front,My name is Allen Diwan.,Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_2-8-rgb_front,"And it's also, cooking the food is also about seeing the color of the food in the dish.",Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_3-8-rgb_front,You'll see the different flavors.,Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_4-8-rgb_front,"You'll see the different ingredients that we are going to put in this dish that you see the unique--the ingre--the colors of each and every ingredient, and this is part of the appeal.",Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_5-8-rgb_front,"I might add one more tomato of this dish, that you can see it's very rustic and you have to make it appetizing for--'cause you eat with your eyes as well, and you want to make this dish as appetizing as possible.",Positive
-9TmNCFEtDo_6-8-rgb_front,"So, this is quite a straight forward recipe, and the ginger, garlic, we're waiting for the ginger to cook properly.",Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_7-8-rgb_front,"And for 1 more 2--1 or 2 more minutes, we'll give it--we'll leave it for 1 or 2 more minutes, and then we'll add our tomatoes to this.",Neutral
-9TmNCFEtDo_8-8-rgb_front,I'm the owner and chef of Kashmir Indian Restaurant in Budapest.,Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_0-8-rgb_front,The dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.,Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_1-8-rgb_front,One ingredient that we'll be adding also is the tomatoes whilst the ginger and the garlic have been cooked slightly.,Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_2-8-rgb_front,"So, just--we'll give it one more shake, stir it once more properly.",Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_3-8-rgb_front,"The onions have been slightly browned now, and we added our green ginger, garlic, and the chilies.",Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_4-8-rgb_front,"We'll wait for that to cook and in the meanwhile, we'll take our tomatoes, maybe about 3 of them, and we'll cut them into cubes.",Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_5-8-rgb_front,"Again, we do not want tomatoes to be cut into very small cubes because we want to see, I mean, obviously, it will be cooked well with the masala, but you'll somehow see the redness of the tomato.",Neutral
-9__F8XKDuE_6-8-rgb_front,As I mentioned earlier most portable electric sanders run on 110 or house current. Pretty much any extension cord will work.,Positive
-9__F8XKDuE_7-8-rgb_front,These sanders don't require significant amounts of power.,Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_0-8-rgb_front,"You don't need a very heavy gauge extension cord, your standard, I think this is a fourteen gauge extension cord, will do.",Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_1-8-rgb_front,"But to power it up, first, make sure your sander is in the off position, make sure the power switch is off.",Positive
-9_jI7kWiQY_2-8-rgb_front,"And then a little helpful thing that I like to do is before I connect my extension cord, to help keep it from coming unplugged while you're using it, we're going to tie a knot in the cord.",Positive
-9_jI7kWiQY_3-8-rgb_front,"We'll just hold the two, come around, draw it into a knot and now you can plug it in.",Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_4-8-rgb_front,Notice that one pole on the extension cord is larger than the other so it will only go in one way.,Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_5-8-rgb_front,Plug it in and you're ready to go.,Positive
-9_jI7kWiQY_6-8-rgb_front,Lesson 12-The Mascara Brush: Every mascara bottle of course comes with a mascara brush.,Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_7-8-rgb_front,They all do come in different shapes and different sizes.,Neutral
-9_jI7kWiQY_8-8-rgb_front,I like this mascara and the best way to apply your mascara and use your mascara brush is to start from the inner most part of your eyelash and wiggle and work your way up to the tip of your eyelash.,Positive
-9byTo0hUbM_9-8-rgb_front,This adds fullness to the eyelash without actually not having to use a volumizer mascara.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_0-8-rgb_front,"Mascara brushes are sold at drug stores or your beauty supply store and they do come in different sizes, like I said, and it is best to change your mascara brush because it tends to build up bacteria and to clump.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_1-8-rgb_front,"The best way to prevent clumping is to actually take your mascara brush, and if you do see any clumps on your brush, is to wipe it off on a napkin or a paper towel that won't leave any residue behind.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_10-8-rgb_front,"It's best not to take your mascara brush and wipe the excess off on the lid of the bottle because that just rubs right back in and that's what causes the clumping, and then you'll have the clumps left over on your eyelashes.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_11-8-rgb_front,That is the mascara brush and that's how you use it.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_12-8-rgb_front,I would like to talk with you now about international stoves.,Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_13-8-rgb_front,When you see the word international you would think about going overseas and you may be going into a country where certain fuels are hard to find.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_14-8-rgb_front,This liquid fuel stove happens to be a white gas stove but they make a version of it that uses multiple fuels.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_15-8-rgb_front,"Kerosene, some of them will even burn diesel, naphta, different fuels that might be easier for you to find elsewhere.",Positive
-9nBmSvp2Co_16-8-rgb_front,"This stove right here has a special feature, if you don't find an MSR cartridge abroad you might find some other ones and they might not have a thread to screw on.",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_17-8-rgb_front,So what this has it has a little catch that goes over top of here and then instead of screwing on it descends down on to the cartridge.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_18-8-rgb_front,These type of stoves give you a little more latitude of what kind of fuel you can get for them.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_2-8-rgb_front,If you have any questions on these types of stoves give your outfitter a holler.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_3-8-rgb_front,So the next step in making your clays is going to be to sieve the mixture.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_4-8-rgb_front,"Now I've got one of these large fancy sieves, it's got brushes on the bottom and it turns, and then it comes with screens at different meshes, this one is 80 mesh",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_5-8-rgb_front,"Anywhere from about 80 to 100 is appropriate for most glazes, a 50 might not be fine enough, and you don't want to go too much thinner than a 100, because some of your materials might not be small enough to go through.",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_6-8-rgb_front,"So you're going to mix, just stir up again, feel the bottom, you want to have a large spoon.",Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_7-8-rgb_front,Make sure that there's no big chunks kind of laying in weight down there.,Neutral
-9nBmSvp2Co_8-8-rgb_front,"And then you'll take a pitcher, and get a scoop, poor it right into your sieve.",Negative
-9nBmSvp2Co_9-8-rgb_front,"And then with this one you just turn the brushes, and that pushes the material through the screen.",Neutral
-9umTJVGSqk_4-8-rgb_front,"If you don't have a big fancy one like this with the brushes, a lot of times wear a rubber clove and just kind of use your hand to work the materials through the screen that works also.",Positive
-9umTJVGSqk_5-8-rgb_front,"So I'm going to go through this entire bucket, and just keep scooping and pushing it through the screen, until I've got the whole thing complete.",Neutral
-9umTJVGSqk_6-8-rgb_front,"That's how you do it, I'm Russ Handler, and I need to make a phone call.",Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_10-8-rgb_front,"Okay, it is efficiently chilled, just brought it out of the refrigerator.",Positive
-9zB8cv_WJk_11-8-rgb_front,It was in there about twenty five minutes or so.,Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_12-8-rgb_front,"Tastes dearly, ooh, okay.",Positive
-9zB8cv_WJk_13-8-rgb_front,"So that's what you look for, just nice solid fudge.",Positive
-9zB8cv_WJk_4-8-rgb_front,"Again, put it in the freezer if you need to.",Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_5-8-rgb_front,"I will say that if you want to take this with you somewhere, try to keep it in a frig.",Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_6-8-rgb_front,"You know if you take it to the office maybe as a little dessert after your lunch, that's a great idea.",Positive
-9zB8cv_WJk_7-8-rgb_front,Just pop it back in the frig when you get to work.,Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_8-8-rgb_front,Because again that coconut oil is very sensitive to temperature.,Neutral
-9zB8cv_WJk_9-8-rgb_front,"So, it's perfectly congealed for me and solidified but as soon as I'm done you know, cutting it and showing you what it looks like I'm going to put it back in the freezer.",Positive
-c5CKp2JWHE_0-5-rgb_front,So just keep that in mind.,Neutral
-c5CKp2JWHE_1-5-rgb_front,"And you can pop it in the freezer if you need to, that's okay too.",Neutral
-c5CKp2JWHE_10-5-rgb_front,You'll see that it's not even.,Neutral
-c5CKp2JWHE_11-5-rgb_front,"We poured it in and it was smooth, and now it looks like a rough rugged terrain that you would need a four wheel drive to go over.",Positive
-c5CKp2JWHE_12-5-rgb_front,But that's okay.,Neutral

00T6xK82A7k_9-5-rgb_front,"When she moves the weight forward that puts a lot more stress on the wrists, so we'll come back, and all of your arm bouncing will generally have, will bend the elbow to keep this crease at a ninety degree angle, so when we come forward bending the elbow",Negative

00kppw3aqus_12-3-rgb_front,"I'm using a couple of cables, one to go from my guitar to my tuner and one to go from my tuner to my amp, so we need two cables if you're using a tuner, one if you're not, and electric tuner and an amplifier.",Neutral

00m1mQFF5zo_0-3-rgb_front,"So it's a pretty good serve, the good news about it is that you are able to really drill the ball at your opponent and a lot of people if you hit the ball at an angle about their shoulder height with a lot of pace, they have a hard time with it.",Positive
00m1mQFF5zo_1-3-rgb_front,The thing to be careful about with an overhead serve though is if you hit it too hard you're not able to get positioned for the next shot.,Neutral
00m1mQFF5zo_10-3-rgb_front,"So just to demonstrate again if you want to just hit it like that, you are going to swing and hit it so we're going to show another angle of this serve so you can just kind of get a feel for the mechanics.",Positive
00m1mQFF5zo_11-3-rgb_front,So as you can see I'm at an open angle with the ball and I just toss the ball and smash it so in the next segment we are going to cover what it looks like from the front and maybe a little bit from the side.,Positive

01G_nWgaYAQ_5-3-rgb_front,"Now the downside, I think, to looking for vintage footwear is in my case, maybe not in all cases, is they tend to be a lot of small sizes, kind of narrow, and a lot of them are hard to find in really good condition.",Neutral

01KR04fE7Fw_0-3-rgb_front,Especially the fancier ones like this.,Positive
01KR04fE7Fw_2-3-rgb_front,"So these one's have some potential, but I might want to bring into a shoe store to get some insoles in here and then maybe have them or myself just maybe hot glue back in some or super glue back in, some little rhinestones in there.",Positive

01m9yM04RwY_7-3-rgb_front,"An extruder is a lot like a giant Play Dough factory, it just squeezes out one very long consistent piece of clay, and I like to use that a lot for many of my different handles.",Positive
01m9yM04RwY_8-3-rgb_front,So the first thing I need to do is prepare the clay for the extruder.,Neutral
01m9yM04RwY_9-3-rgb_front,"Now my extruder has a 4 inch cylindrical barrel, so I need to get a piece of clay that's going to fit in there nicely.",Positive
01okYWMvD-0_0-3-rgb_front,So I'm going to cut a piece off.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_1-3-rgb_front,"And then I'm going to pound it on the table, to round out the corners.",Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_2-3-rgb_front,And then I'm going to pat to elongate it and thin it out just a little bit more.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_3-3-rgb_front,Now I want it to be smaller than the actual size of the barrel of the extruder itself so that it will slip in there really easily and it won't get jammed or anything like that.,Positive
01okYWMvD-0_4-3-rgb_front,So now the clay is prepared and I'll show you over at the extruder how this works.,Neutral
01okYWMvD-0_5-3-rgb_front,Hi my name is Lauren and today I am here to discuss how to brush your hair.,Neutral
01ucR6XreJw_1-5-rgb_front,Brushing your hair has a few different advantages.,Positive

01ucR6XreJw_11-5-rgb_front,It also increases the blood circulation to your brain which nourishes your papilla.,Neutral
01ucR6XreJw_12-5-rgb_front,"Once the blood circulation actually increases towards your brain and towards your scalp your nutrients, your papilla which is where the base of your hair follicle is going to grab nutrients out of your bloodstream and help nourish your hair so it is a very good thing to be in the habit of brushing your hair on a regular basis.",Positive
01ucR6XreJw_13-5-rgb_front,The easiest way to brush your hair especially if your hair is rather knotted is to start at the bottom of the end of the shaft and work your way up.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_3-5-rgb_front,If you use a Boar's Head bristle then it will also help promote smoothness in your hair and it will help maintain frizz.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_4-5-rgb_front,Plastic bristles will also help get all of those knots out because it has a bit of a better grab to it.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_5-5-rgb_front,So again you are going to start at the end of your hair shaft and you are going to work your way up towards your root.,Neutral
01ucR6XreJw_6-5-rgb_front,Once you get towards your root you can then do a few really good brush strokes in order to increase that circulation and have more blood flow go up to your scalp and that is how to brush your hair.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_7-5-rgb_front,In this next clip we're going to be going over a hook kick. Ok. A hook is a very powerful kick.,Positive
01ucR6XreJw_8-5-rgb_front,"We're going to take a step, skip, hook it. One more time from here. Step, skip, hiya. Ok. Now when I'm kicking I'm kicking with the very bottom part of my foot.",Neutral

025gAKRCIKY_0_1-3-rgb_front,The whole foot is going to be pointed straight and I'm going to hook that all the way across. Ok. That's our kicking position.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_10-3-rgb_front,So again from here.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_11-3-rgb_front,And that is going to be your skip hook kick.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_12-3-rgb_front,It is the opposite of a round kick.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_2-3-rgb_front,"O.k., I'm Bobby Larew.",Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_3-3-rgb_front,One of the drills you can do to work on your front entries is just called a line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_4-3-rgb_front,I should go in vertical and I should be working on my pike save at the end.,Positive
025gAKRCIKY_5-3-rgb_front,So I'm going to go walk up to the 3 meter and do a front line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_6-3-rgb_front,"A line up I'm going to do on the 3 meter board, o.k.",Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_7-3-rgb_front,I do that because it gives me enough height and I don't have to worry about doing a good hurdle to practice a line up.,Positive
025gAKRCIKY_8-3-rgb_front,You can solely concentrate on the line up.,Neutral
025gAKRCIKY_9-3-rgb_front,"A good line up I'm going to go to the end of the board feet together, I'm going to bend at the waste and extend my arms.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_1-8-rgb_front,"What I'm concentrating on is making sure I get my hands closed above my head, make sure my elbows are locked, my biceps are squeezing my head and my ears.",Positive
028cpYJmYAk_10-8-rgb_front,Make sure I have no arch like I'm sucking my back this way,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_2-8-rgb_front,"I want to have nice tight legs, thighs spread apart",Positive
028cpYJmYAk_4-8-rgb_front,I shouldn't get a lot of splash.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_5-8-rgb_front,"We actually used the sewing machine for this, and basically we had two pieces of fabric.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_6-8-rgb_front,I'm just going to get my little cloth and just dampen it up a little bit.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_7-8-rgb_front,And then we're going to put that on there.,Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_8-8-rgb_front,"Again, make sure none of the fusing is actually sticking out, because if it gets on your iron board, it's really sticky and it gets on your iron and it's impossible to get out.",Neutral
028cpYJmYAk_9-8-rgb_front,"Like that, put that down, see how it steams, and it's sealing it shut for us right now.",Positive
02CpakICRL4_1-8-rgb_front,Slide it around a little bit.,Neutral
02CpakICRL4_2-8-rgb_front,"There you have it, a very adorable pumpkin placemat that's going to last for years.",Positive
02CpakICRL4_3-8-rgb_front,We made sure of that when we used the zigzag stitched the edges.,Neutral
02CpakICRL4_4-8-rgb_front,You can throw it in the washing machine and it's going to hold it beautifully.,Positive
02CpakICRL4_5-8-rgb_front,"Stick around, I'm going to show you a few tricks for embellishing before we go.",Neutral
02CpakICRL4_6-8-rgb_front,"We used the zigzag stitch around, and turn it right side out, and we actually have a little spot that we're going to slip-stitch but I had an epiphany as I was ironing, because you are going to want to just iron your placemat so all of your edges are nice and flat.",Positive
02CpakICRL4_7-8-rgb_front,"Go around and we're not going to actually slip-stitch, we are going to use our fusible tape to finish this placemat.",Neutral
02CpakICRL4_8-8-rgb_front,"So I'm just going to measure, it's a very, very little area, very small area that I need to finish here.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_0-8-rgb_front,"So you just measure and cut, and again be sure you measure the exact length because if you go over and it ends up sticking out and the iron gets on it, it's going to get really hot and it's going to make the outside of your fabric really sticky and that's going to start to bunch up and you don't want that.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_1-8-rgb_front,So really kind of take your time in measuring how much tape you?re going to use.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_10-8-rgb_front,"Just fold your fabric under on both sides like that, you just tuck it in, use your finger to do the corner.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_11-8-rgb_front,"Lay that down, but make sure your tape does go all the way to the corner, otherwise you're going to have a little open corner and you don't want that either.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_12-8-rgb_front,"Go ahead and lay it flat and I'm just going to get, my iron is hot but not too height though.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_13-8-rgb_front,"The game of Baroness solitaire is an adding game at its heart, and the number you're trying to get to, the sum",Positive

02LnULLXds4_15-8-rgb_front,What'll I do now?,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_16-8-rgb_front,Next segment.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_17-8-rgb_front,The king is thirteen by himself.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_18-8-rgb_front,"So aces are worth one, twos are worth two, three is three",Positive
02LnULLXds4_19-8-rgb_front,"So, how does that work in a real example?",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_2-8-rgb_front,"Well the cards I have dealt at the start of this hand of baroness are an ace, a two, a ten, a ten, and a three.",Positive
02LnULLXds4_20-8-rgb_front,"So, if I want combinations that add up to thirteen, at this point all I have are a three plus one of the tens.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_21-8-rgb_front,So I'm going to take down this three and this ten.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_22-8-rgb_front,That adds up to thirteen.,Neutral
02LnULLXds4_23-8-rgb_front,There are no more moves.,Neutral

02LnULLXds4_3-8-rgb_front,"And now, again the arm position is going to vary.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_30-8-rgb_front,"If you're doing more Tribal Fusion, or if you're doing more Improvisational Tribal Style.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_31-8-rgb_front,"So, it depends on where your arms are supposed to go, but ultimately, you want your isolations to remain nice and precise.",Positive

02LnULLXds4_7-8-rgb_front,"Alright, you have Improvisational Tribal style which developed out of San Francisco in the 1980s and that's where you dance with a group working on cues and improvisations.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_8-8-rgb_front,"In that case, what you needed to do to practice is to practice with your group.",Neutral
02LnULLXds4_9-8-rgb_front,There are certain moves that you need to practice over and over and over again until you have them precisely correct.,Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_0-3-rgb_front,"Now, there's also Tribal Fusion styles of belly dance which developed a little bit later, and there's many, many different movements for that.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_1-3-rgb_front,"So, depending on what you're practicing, everything comes back to having your basic isolations.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_2-3-rgb_front,"So, you want to practice in front of a mirror with your partners, or if you're doing solo, by yourself, making sure your feet are together, under your hips, your knees are bent.",Positive
02M-Xcs3X30_3-3-rgb_front,This is a lead weight welded to an alligator clip.,Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_4-3-rgb_front,"We want to hook that to the snell on the hook and drop it down the hole, laying out our line until such time that we get slack.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_5-3-rgb_front,"When we have slack, we know we're on the bottom. There's our slack. We want to mark that and pull it up.",Neutral
02M-Xcs3X30_6-3-rgb_front,Then we know exactly how much line to reel in so that we know that our bait is just off of the bottom.,Neutral

02QGTJlJYnM_12-8-rgb_front,It doesn't really affect the game at all.,Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_13-8-rgb_front,Some people feel just more comfortable and like to have more control over how they catch the ball if their finger is on the outside.,Positive
02QGTJlJYnM_14-8-rgb_front,"Now, if we were to take an infielder's glove, you'd take a couple of inches off of the end of this glove right here.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_15-8-rgb_front,An infielder's glove is much smaller.,Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_16-8-rgb_front,"It's because they're used to field the ball on the ground, so you want less size.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_17-8-rgb_front,"In the outfield, you need a bigger pocket, a little bit thicker.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_18-8-rgb_front,"Now, the first baseman's glove is the exact opposite.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_19-8-rgb_front,It's larger than your standard outfielder's glove.,Neutral

02QGTJlJYnM_3-8-rgb_front,"In the Major League level, pitchers are throwing in the mid to upper 90s with regularity, so you want a thick pad for your catcher's mitt.",Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_4-8-rgb_front,But any glove will do for any position,Neutral
02QGTJlJYnM_5-8-rgb_front,And that's all about the glove.,Neutral

02WRxAwx-Bo_23-8-rgb_front,"It's really hard to be honest and look inside ourselves and say, ""okay, what did I do to contribute to this breakup"", if anything, maybe nothing, but, it's good for you to take a look at that and analyze it.",Neutral
02WRxAwx-Bo_24-8-rgb_front,"The other thing you want to do is also, your response may differ, whether you're, what we call an internal directed person, perhaps you think about it a lot, you're going to, you're going to internalize it, you're not going to speak to your friends, you're just kind of go and go quiet walks on the beach, process that information by yourself.",Positive

02gzHnpz1W4_20-8-rgb_front,"What that means is you're going to have to have a pack that can carry heavier loads, but if you're able to go into town, say go to the grocery store and buy more food, then you can carry less food and just resupply as you go along.",Neutral

03513v6_5TU_2-8-rgb_front,"Although you can go both ways, again if you look at the claws on a rafter such as an eagle, and you look at the claws on a Komodo dragon or other large lizard, monitor lizard, or even some dinosaur bones, you'll find the talons very similar.",Neutral
03513v6_5TU_3-8-rgb_front,"Long serpentine neck, and I've got this one curving around on itself, and of course you're going to want a tail.",Neutral
03513v6_5TU_4-8-rgb_front,"This is also again, good looking monitor lizards for references and dinosaurs, dinosaur restructures or bones.",Positive
03513v6_5TU_5-8-rgb_front,"And of course the really tricky part, the head.",Neutral
03513v6_5TU_6-8-rgb_front,And this can be done a lot of ways and however you like.,Positive

03513v6_5TU_9-8-rgb_front,I have and affection for doing pupilless on dragons to make them look more mystical.,Positive
038vE9JsU9I_0-8-rgb_front,"But if you're wanting something that looks more like a real animal, then you might want to do snake like slitted pupils.",Positive

038vE9JsU9I_2-8-rgb_front,I tend to give two very big horns.,Neutral
038vE9JsU9I_3-8-rgb_front,But you can do it as a single big horn or no horns at all.,Negative
038vE9JsU9I_4-8-rgb_front,Some extra wings around the jaw line gives a nice touch.,Positive
038vE9JsU9I_5-8-rgb_front,And then a good series of ridges that start maybe at the brow ridge or even at the tip of the nose.,Positive

03EzcoSP2pc_0-8-rgb_front,And then we have our wings.,Neutral
03EzcoSP2pc_1-8-rgb_front,Wings basically follow a bat wing.,Neutral
03EzcoSP2pc_10-8-rgb_front,"They have an elbow and then essentially fingers, all stem from the same spot.",Neutral
03EzcoSP2pc_11-8-rgb_front,Again this is a good way to get it to look more like a real animal that way.,Positive
03EzcoSP2pc_12-8-rgb_front,"But we have our very fun, what we're going to do here today, is the fore legged mythological, where they're all mythological, four legged and winged dragon.",Positive
03EzcoSP2pc_13-8-rgb_front,"You can do dragon wings just about anyway you want really, but they're depicted lots of different ways.",Neutral
03EzcoSP2pc_14-8-rgb_front,And that's your basic lesson in how to draw a dragon.,Neutral

03EzcoSP2pc_6-8-rgb_front,"Such as the any, just about any four legged creature has very long front legs, long and straight whereas there's a lot more, a lot more joints to the back leg.",Neutral

03SgrpiJkSw_1-8-rgb_front,"Even if it is a slow jog, a fast jog, something, just keep moving constantly.",Neutral
03SgrpiJkSw_10-8-rgb_front,"Now when it comes to running in a competition, you might find that throughout your run you want to throw in a sprint, because when you throw in a sprint you got certain type of mobilizers within your body that are meant for sprinting.",Positive

03SgrpiJkSw_12-8-rgb_front,"After you throw in a sprint, just go to a slow jog to a fast jog go back down, but always keep running",Neutral
03SgrpiJkSw_13-8-rgb_front,"So okay I run for this long this many hours, this many minutes, you go ahead and time your self put on a wrist watch or get someone to hold a stopwatch for you, but go ahead maybe put on some type of distance, and say I'm going to run this far and run that distance and know how well you do.",Positive
03SgrpiJkSw_14-8-rgb_front,"You can slowly expand on that, and if you are trying to do a specific kind of competition, go ahead and see what those requirements are for that competition, speed is, how fast people usually do things and how do they feel afterwards.",Neutral
03SgrpiJkSw_2-8-rgb_front,"Just kind of what there strategies are and go ahead, and compare your results and their results.",Neutral

03VktV6bl7c_2-8-rgb_front,You just go ahead and trace it we're going to lift up the little nose guard part and come back down.,Neutral
03VktV6bl7c_3-8-rgb_front,This doesn't has to be exact cause we're going to clean it up when we cut it out.,Neutral

03VktV6bl7c_5-8-rgb_front,What you do when you are actually free handing something is you go ahead and just fold it in half and then we'll cut it out so the other side is the exact same shape.,Neutral
03VktV6bl7c_6-8-rgb_front,"Before you start with your spray tan, you want to make sure that your area is completely covered or protected.",Positive
03VktV6bl7c_7-8-rgb_front,"If you're doing this at home, maybe do it in the shower or even outside for that matter, in the middle of a large area, maybe not, definitely not on a carpeted area or anywhere where there's fabric.",Neutral

03WUE9zzQY4_11-8-rgb_front,"Make sure your area is pay close attention to make sure that anything that is absorbent, fabrics are your biggest thing that the spray would absorb to.",Positive
03WUE9zzQY4_12-8-rgb_front,"Your can sprays that you buy in a store also have the same DHA active ingredient but it's not the strength, like a prescription strength like what we use here.",Positive
03WUE9zzQY4_13-8-rgb_front,"So it probably will come out of your fabrics a little easier but again, make sure you're spraying in an area that is nonporous, would be the best way to put that.",Positive

03jABW2MKkk_14-8-rgb_front,We're going to come up and right when we get to the arch we're really going to twist the brush in our hand and that's how we can get that nice bow in her lip.,Positive
03jABW2MKkk_15-8-rgb_front,"This side, twist and connect and do the same thing on the bottom lip and the other one.",Neutral
03jABW2MKkk_2-8-rgb_front,You got her lips and then just fill them in.,Neutral
03jABW2MKkk_3-8-rgb_front,It's a great lipstick application technique.,Positive
03jABW2MKkk_4-8-rgb_front,"So now in the same with the forward in same position we want to move it up just a little bit and where the upper ridges are now are in the kidney, meridian area and in this position, it actually stimulates the kidney and the kidney meridian.",Neutral

03lzv6OzJhE_1-8-rgb_front,"That's where it starts, is with trapping that line.",Neutral
03lzv6OzJhE_10-8-rgb_front,"If you're using the thumb-on-top grip, basically just use your index finger and trap that line there, or if you're using the index finger on top, you can grab it with that next finger.",Neutral

03w0fj9vLpo_14-8-rgb_front,But what we haven't gone over is that every company makes their bras differently.,Neutral
03w0fj9vLpo_15-8-rgb_front,A 28 E is an American DD.,Neutral
03w0fj9vLpo_2-8-rgb_front,"So in America an E is the same as a UK F. And it just keeps going that way, so it's always good to ask for help because otherwise you'll just make yourself crazy.",Positive
03w0fj9vLpo_3-8-rgb_front,"For example, this company is called Natori, and they make a bra that is wider in the wire and shallow in the cup.",Neutral
03w0fj9vLpo_4-8-rgb_front,"So while this bra is a 32 D, it's not for a D-cup who is fuller this way",Neutral
03w0fj9vLpo_5-8-rgb_front,"And also, this company makes a very stretchy band, so if you find out that well you've been wearing a 34 inch band for years and years and years then you should be wearing a 32.",Neutral
03w0fj9vLpo_6-8-rgb_front,This is a great bra to start transitioning with because it stretches out a little bit quicker than others do.,Positive
03w0fj9vLpo_7-8-rgb_front,Another example is this company called Freya.,Neutral

03w0fj9vLpo_9-8-rgb_front,"So, for example, if you know somebody who measures 26 inches around and is really busty on top, they might wear a 28 G. And they could get that from Freya.",Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_0-8-rgb_front,"UK sizing is a little different, so when you're in the store and you see numbers, ask for help.",Positive
03xD5BhCG94_1-8-rgb_front,Right now we are at a big kick in this country to try to get our kids back into boosters.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_10-8-rgb_front,Parents have used car seats for so long they are so anxious to get there kids out of boosters seats but there is truly not a kinder gardener out there that doesn't need a booster seat and probably most of the first graders out there need them.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_11-8-rgb_front,The law would be changing very soon to require boosters seats to 8 years old and most booster seats goes to 80 and 100 pounds most of them now go to a 100 pounds.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_12-8-rgb_front,So we are going to show you a 5 step test and this is what you do in your vehicle to know when your child should actually not need a booster anymore.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_13-8-rgb_front,You can't really go by age or weight guidelines so much anymore because seats are so different from vehicle to vehicle.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_14-8-rgb_front,For example this seat is out of a Chevy silverado this is the same kind of seat that you would find in a suburban or a Yukon as a very long base.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_15-8-rgb_front,It would very say a child that fits in a compact car or something geometry or a cooper a mini cooper it may have a very small seat base.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_16-8-rgb_front,They would fit fine and they wont fit in here so it is going to very from vehicle to vehicle you got to do this test for the child in the vehicle that you are going to put the child in.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_17-8-rgb_front,The next step before you actually apply the acrylic is to just go back and double check everything you've done.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_18-8-rgb_front,"You want to make sure that the nails have been roughed up, that you've applied the tips and that they're not hanging off the side.",Positive
03xD5BhCG94_19-8-rgb_front,"The reason for double checking the tips, especially is if they are too wide, when you put the acrylic on, eventually that acrylics going to lift.",Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_2-8-rgb_front,You want to make sure that it doesn't lift.,Positive
03xD5BhCG94_20-8-rgb_front,Lifting can cause moisture to get in and can cause mold.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_21-8-rgb_front,"You just want to make sure that you don't have any cuticle left on the nail, again, because that could lead to some lifting issues.",Positive
03xD5BhCG94_22-8-rgb_front,"If you see anything that you need to get off, just go back and get it off.",Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_23-8-rgb_front,"You just want to double check before you start so that you don't have any problems later on in the process, as you go.",Positive
03xD5BhCG94_24-8-rgb_front,"Once you make sure you have everything correct, you can start your acrylic application, but it's definitely good to make sure you've put on the bond aid, you've put on the primer, that you have all of your steps completed, and this is how you double check the work you've just done.",Positive

03xD5BhCG94_3-8-rgb_front,It has stars for power and toughness ought to be.,Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_4-8-rgb_front,"So again, this means that something on the card is going to tell you what these equal.",Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_5-8-rgb_front,"This creature has flying, which means they can only be blocked by flying creatures and/or creatures with reach and ""Nightmare's"" cool power is that its power and toughness are equal to each of the number of swamps you control, which means that if you have 6 swamps, if you play this with all black mana, then you at least have a 6/6 creature with flying, which means your mana production is perfectly equal for this card, and/or you could play this card in any multicolored deck, and you could still get pretty much even mana production as long as you have enough swamps to put enough power and toughness on them.",Positive
03xD5BhCG94_6-8-rgb_front,"Also, this goes up every time you have a swamp so this has unlimited potential.",Neutral
03xD5BhCG94_7-8-rgb_front,It's a very powerful card.,Positive
03xD5BhCG94_8-8-rgb_front,"And now I'm going to discuss ""Nightmare"".",Neutral

04-j8JucIXg_1-8-rgb_front,It has always been a rare and it has been around for a long time.,Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_10-8-rgb_front,"So again, we have creature ""Nightmare"", which means it is a nightmare creature that gets benefits for anything that benefits nightmares.",Positive
04-j8JucIXg_11-8-rgb_front,"""Nightmare"" cost you 5 and a black, which means its converted mana cost is 6.",Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_12-8-rgb_front,"This means that you're getting a very big creature or a very cool creature, in which case this is both.",Positive
04-j8JucIXg_2-8-rgb_front,"So again, as you see down here, ""Nightmare"" does not have power and toughness.",Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_3-8-rgb_front,"Alright, the next shot you want to learn is your snap shot.",Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_4-8-rgb_front,"Basically, it's the difference between a wrist shot and a slap shot.",Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_5-8-rgb_front,"It's not too difficult, but, again, the same thing, the same thing as a wrist shot, pretty much, just the extra snap.",Positive
04-j8JucIXg_6-8-rgb_front,It's kind of in between there of what you're going to do.,Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_7-8-rgb_front,"For a snap shot, just like the wrist shot, you're going to plant yourself, put a little bend in your knees.",Positive
04-j8JucIXg_8-8-rgb_front,Get your hands on your stick.,Neutral
04-j8JucIXg_9-8-rgb_front,You can stick handle.,Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_0-5-rgb_front,"And then all you're going to do is you're going to pull it back, just like the wrist shot, but then you're going to pull all of your weight back on to the back foot, and then you're going to transfer your weight on to the front foot.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_1-5-rgb_front,"But this time with the stick, you're going to actually snap it, you're going to snap the stick and follow through.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_10-5-rgb_front,"And sometimes that gives you a little bit harder shot than your wrist shot, your typical wrist shot.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_11-5-rgb_front,And that's pretty much a snap shot.,Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_12-5-rgb_front,"Today, in this segment of bar tools, I'm going to discuss the bar spoon.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_13-5-rgb_front,"Now, your bar spoon is a long spoon, it's twisted in the center.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_14-5-rgb_front,The other example that I'm going to show you is layering your drinks.,Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_15-5-rgb_front,"You're going to want to start with your shot glass, obviously and from that point, you're going to take your first liqueur, this is a Butterscotch Schnapps.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_16-5-rgb_front,And we're going to pour about halfway up.,Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_17-5-rgb_front,"From that point, you're going to take your bar spoon and your next, which is going to be Bailey's Irish Creme, and you're going to just want to penetrate the surface of whatever your first or base alcohol is and pour the second one directly on top of the spoon, like such.",Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_18-5-rgb_front,"And see how it gives you a really nice, distinct, separated layer there.",Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_19-5-rgb_front,"So, those are the uses of your bar spoon.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_2-5-rgb_front,Always recommend having this behind the bar and take good care of it.,Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_20-5-rgb_front,"It may or may not have an end, like such.",Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_3-5-rgb_front,This is a flat circular end.,Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_4-5-rgb_front,There's a lot of uses for this.,Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_5-5-rgb_front,"Most common, basically stirring your drinks, layering shots or Martinis and scraping out all that ice at the bottom of the blender.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_6-5-rgb_front,"So, really quickly, first use that I explained was stirring your drinks.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_7-5-rgb_front,"When this is filled with ice and all of your contents, you're just going to place the spoon in like that to the bottom, and just stir it.",Positive
04DtdCu2kfg_8-5-rgb_front,"And what this does, it allows you to prevent bruising your drink.",Neutral
04DtdCu2kfg_9-5-rgb_front,It's just a different method of mixing your ingredients as opposed to shaking.,Neutral

06S7xXXHWIs_0-5-rgb_front,You need to make sure that you achieve particular temperatures.,Neutral
06S7xXXHWIs_1-5-rgb_front,This will help you to make sure that you're not too hot or too cool.,Positive
06S7xXXHWIs_10-5-rgb_front,There's one other stage that you want to use this at.,Neutral

06S7xXXHWIs_2-5-rgb_front,You've got to make sure that your beer is not too hot.,Neutral
06S7xXXHWIs_3-5-rgb_front,If you put the living yeast in to too hot of an environment it'll kill the yeast.,Negative

06St8W_JHok_0-5-rgb_front,We also have one that's a very fast reader.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_1-5-rgb_front,We call it the lab thermometer.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_10-5-rgb_front,"It doesn't float, but it reads real quickly, so you immerse it in to the liquid and get a reading with in maybe fifteen seconds or so.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_11-5-rgb_front,"And then the lastly we have our dial type thermometer, which has a little clip on the side of it.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_12-5-rgb_front,"You could put it on the side of a kettle and monitor the temperature inside of the either wort, or when you're actually taking your temperature right before you pitch the yeast.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_13-5-rgb_front,"So, a few different types of thermometer's that you can use in brewing.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_14-5-rgb_front,"We're going to talk about thermometers right now, which is more applicable to beer than wine, although some people will take, use high, use a thermometer for wine making.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_15-5-rgb_front,It's generally more applicable to beer making.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_16-5-rgb_front,"But, none-the-less, we sell a different, a few different varieties of thermometers.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_17-5-rgb_front,I'll just show you three different varieties here to start out with.,Neutral

06St8W_JHok_21-5-rgb_front,"Hemostats, those are good for mashing down the barbs on your hooks, also good for grabbing a hook and getting it out of fish's mouth, and these have a nice little feature here that you can actually mash the split shot down with.",Positive
06St8W_JHok_22-5-rgb_front,Another real nice thing to have is a hook sharpener for obvious reasons,Positive
06St8W_JHok_23-5-rgb_front,"This one's cool 'cause it's made out of a ceramic material, so it won't rust, and I've had that one for years and it's been in saltwater, it's been in fresh water, and it still keeps my hooks nice and sharp.",Positive
06St8W_JHok_24-5-rgb_front,"As far as tools go, that's your basics.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_25-5-rgb_front,"There's a lot of other stuff you can have pliers, pocket knife, but if you got clippers and hemostats, hook sharpener, that should get you by.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_26-5-rgb_front,"They come in all different sizes and shapes, bigger ones, longer ones, some of them are brightly colored, some of them are colored, anodized like a matte black so they don't reflect light.",Positive
06St8W_JHok_27-5-rgb_front,"There's just different hemostats for different finger sizes, you name it.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_3-5-rgb_front,"Another really important tool and a kind of a must-have tool is your clippers obviously for clipping the line, if you add and tip it or you got a knot and you need to cut your leader to retie it, you want to have clippers.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_4-5-rgb_front,Another thing that's important on your clippers is this little needle.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_5-5-rgb_front,This one actually has a retractable needle.,Neutral
06St8W_JHok_6-5-rgb_front,"That's really good, like say you've got the eye of your flies all gunked up.",Positive
06St8W_JHok_7-5-rgb_front,"Sometimes when they tie them, they'll have an extra paint or glue covering the eye and you can use that needle to poke out the eye.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_8-5-rgb_front,"Also if you get a tangle, you can actually use that needle to stick in there and kind of untangle the knot you have in your line.",Neutral
06St8W_JHok_9-5-rgb_front,So we've got our three pound ball of clay.,Neutral

06Yvm4X81WI_11-5-rgb_front,"Make a fist and push down, all the while, your left hand is just serving as support.",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_12-5-rgb_front,"It's not really doing anything but keep the clay, on center.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_13-5-rgb_front,"You push down, into the center a little bit, with that fist that you've made and once you've made the well here, you want to check the depth, with your needle tool.",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_14-5-rgb_front,"For a berry bowl, you probably want, that's about an inch and that's probably about right because we're going to have a trimmed foot on there, so you need to leave room for that.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_2-5-rgb_front,"Next, we'll pull the walls.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_3-5-rgb_front,"So, as we drop into this dragon position, a lot of whether your foot is flat on the floor is going to depend on your ankle flexibility.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_4-5-rgb_front,Many people don't have the flexibility to be able to put their heel flat on the floor in this position.,Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_5-5-rgb_front,"So, it's perfectly fine to keep that ankle bent up to whatever angle you need to in order to maintain this position.",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_6-5-rgb_front,"The ankle is not necessarily important, it's keeping the body sunk down over the leg, which is important, wherever your ankle manages to be in that position is fine.",Neutral
06Yvm4X81WI_7-5-rgb_front,"That being said, the more you can draw your heel down to the floor and sink forward, the more you're going to be gaining flexibility in the ankle and that's going to help your martial arts training, especially when we're doing kicks and using darthaflexion and Plantar flexion for thrusting forward",Positive
06Yvm4X81WI_8-5-rgb_front,"Chopping is another sort of a stroke that we can use on the horse's, this one in particular you have to be careful where you are using it.",Neutral

06bQ_DxQGJU_0-5-rgb_front,"And you hold your hand this way, the fingers closed and you are actually striking the horse with the side of your hand.",Positive
06bQ_DxQGJU_1-5-rgb_front,And you can use a fair amount of pressure when you are doing this.,Neutral
06bQ_DxQGJU_2-5-rgb_front,You really want to be careful and be paying attention to what you are doing.,Neutral
06bQ_DxQGJU_3-5-rgb_front,"Watch your horse for signs of reaction, watch your horse for flinching and be feeling with your hand while you are doing it.",Positive
06bQ_DxQGJU_4-5-rgb_front,"Watch your horse is doing, how, what their reaction is to it.",Neutral
06bQ_DxQGJU_5-5-rgb_front,"If they start to duck away from what you are doing and you need to back off, perhaps that's an area where you should be using a different sort of a stroke.",Neutral
06bQ_DxQGJU_6-5-rgb_front,"But again you want to keep your fingers closed, use the sides of your hand and just use light moderate and heavy pressure.",Positive
06bQ_DxQGJU_7-5-rgb_front,And be careful where you're using that sort of a stroke.,Neutral
06bQ_DxQGJU_8-5-rgb_front,Our next stretch is going to be a side stretch.,Neutral
06d7cIO6KsA_0-5-rgb_front,Let's go ahead and taking the hands by your side and stretching one side at a time we'll start with the right side inhaling up with the right arm.,Neutral

06jk1stVwMI_1-5-rgb_front,Then you exhale and slowly take it over to the side.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_10-5-rgb_front,You like to look up at your hand as you're stretching feeling it stretch and deepening the stretch along your side.,Positive
06jk1stVwMI_11-5-rgb_front,"This bottom hand, every exhalation the elbow getting closer to the floor.",Positive
06jk1stVwMI_12-5-rgb_front,"So as you inhale you lift, exhale dropping closer to the floor reaching the hand up towards the ceiling farther along to the side of the wall.",Positive
06jk1stVwMI_13-5-rgb_front,Inhale and exhale stretching deeper.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_14-5-rgb_front,The next exhale you'll slowly bring it back to center and then do the same thing on the other side.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_15-5-rgb_front,Deep breath inhale left arm comes up and then exhale slowly taking it over.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_16-5-rgb_front,Inhale and then exhale.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_17-5-rgb_front,"And today, we are going to be doing a method or a technique called a stepping stone.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_18-5-rgb_front,"They are strong enough to step on, like I said, but people think they're too pretty to step on.",Positive
06jk1stVwMI_19-5-rgb_front,So don't worry about it.,Positive
06jk1stVwMI_2-5-rgb_front,I'm going to show you what to do and have fun with it.,Positive
06jk1stVwMI_20-5-rgb_front,"So what we're going to do, we actually need a mold.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_21-5-rgb_front,These are called stepping-stone molds.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_22-5-rgb_front,"They come in a variety of sizes and, of course, they're available at your local stained glass store.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_23-5-rgb_front,"So anyway, they are fairly expensive, I think, but as far as many stones that you can get them, they're actually worth every penny.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_24-5-rgb_front,"In fact, they turn out to be quite cheap at that point.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_25-5-rgb_front,"So anyway, find a size you like or start with a pattern first.",Positive
06jk1stVwMI_26-5-rgb_front,So check it out on the next step.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_3-5-rgb_front,"And what we're going to do is we're going to be using art glass and/or stained glass for the surface of the stone, and then it's going to be poured with a bunch of grout.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_4-5-rgb_front,"Believe it or not, these things are incredibly durable.",Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_5-5-rgb_front,"In fact, not only durable, they're heavy.",Neutral

06jk1stVwMI_7-5-rgb_front,"They're so pretty. They are strong enough to step on. They're strong enough for water. They're going to make it through the seasons, if you do the couple of techniques to make it help--last through the ages.",Positive
06jk1stVwMI_8-5-rgb_front,First I want to tell you what the purpose is of preparing your platform statement.,Neutral
06jk1stVwMI_9-5-rgb_front,When most young ladies enter a pageant they are required to have a platform.,Neutral
06k75HRlfqc_0-8-rgb_front,"And a platform can consist of something that you believe in very strongly, it can consist of something, say an organization that you've been a part of for a long time.",Neutral
06k75HRlfqc_1-8-rgb_front,But it is a purpose for which you have that you want to represent if you win the title of the pageant.,Positive
06k75HRlfqc_10-8-rgb_front,And I'm going to talk about how to prepare the platform statement that you're going to turn into the judges so that they can read this about you and determine whether or not your platform is strong enough to support your pageant title.,Positive
06k75HRlfqc_2-8-rgb_front,"One of the main reasons that you need a platform is during the course of the pageant at some point you're going to have to get, introduce yourself on stage and tell everyone what your platform is.",Neutral
06k75HRlfqc_3-8-rgb_front,So I'm going to demonstrate that now.,Neutral

06k75HRlfqc_7-8-rgb_front,"Knead by hand, until you have the window, that's a very good question.",Positive
06k75HRlfqc_8-8-rgb_front,"I don't think, at home, you can really mess it up, by over mixing it.",Negative
06k75HRlfqc_9-8-rgb_front,"It's best to watch it and just make sure the ingredients are mixed properly, without being over mixed.",Positive
06tA1xvaSt8_0-5-rgb_front,"If you over mix it, your cookies will run.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_1-5-rgb_front,"If you over mix your muffin, your muffin will run because what happens is, you will incorporate so much air in it, that the air, in there, will bubble up and make the cookie and the muffin, run.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_10-5-rgb_front,"Now, what is a window?",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_11-5-rgb_front,Let me show you what a window is.,Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_12-5-rgb_front,"A window is when you pack the dough and you stretch it out and the dough becomes so smooth, this is what you call a window.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_13-5-rgb_front,"Where you stretch your dough, until it becomes thin and when you hold it, up to the light, you can see the light come through it, without getting torn and without getting tears in it or without getting holes in it, that's when your dough is ready.",Positive
06tA1xvaSt8_2-5-rgb_front,"So, at home, when you knead it, you have to knead it enough.",Neutral
06tA1xvaSt8_3-5-rgb_front,"Every so often, take a piece of it, look for your window and if you have your window, your dough is ready.",Positive
06tA1xvaSt8_4-5-rgb_front,So that's one way to do it.,Neutral

072DGdBjfkQ_19-5-rgb_front,Good.,Positive

072DGdBjfkQ_25-5-rgb_front,It's basically like a hot chocolate except it's going to be Irish cream flavored.,Positive
072DGdBjfkQ_26-5-rgb_front,"Remember though, if you are going to make something with fruit flavors to cut it with vanilla, or if you have like a thick syrup like chocolate, you can cut it with that, too.",Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_3-5-rgb_front,It's not going to curdle.,Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_4-5-rgb_front,"And that is how you make an Irish cream steamer, also known as the cream of steamer.",Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_5-5-rgb_front,All right.,Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_6-5-rgb_front,"In this clip, I'm going to explain to you real quickly how to make an Irish cream steamer.",Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_7-5-rgb_front,This is basically just going to be the steamed milk and then your flavor.,Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_8-5-rgb_front,"It sounds really, really fancy but it's not.",Neutral
072DGdBjfkQ_9-5-rgb_front,"If you have like kids in the house or people who don't like coffee, this is a great drink to make because it doesn't have espresso.",Positive
075s9DECj2k_1-5-rgb_front,"All right, we got our milk steamed.",Neutral
075s9DECj2k_10-5-rgb_front,"What we're going to do, we got our sugar for the Irish cream.",Neutral
075s9DECj2k_2-5-rgb_front,"One, two, three pumps.",Neutral
075s9DECj2k_3-5-rgb_front,"SAL COLLURA: Okay, now that we've gone through the days of the week, I'd like to get specific for certain events.",Positive
075s9DECj2k_4-5-rgb_front,Let's start with road racing.,Neutral
075s9DECj2k_5-5-rgb_front,"Okay, so hit the hill as hard as you possibly can in the biggest gear you can.",Neutral
075s9DECj2k_6-5-rgb_front,"Either you're turning around and coming back downhill, or if you can make a loop out of it, but you need a few minutes, less than 10, of recovery.",Neutral
075s9DECj2k_7-5-rgb_front,So you get a couple of 3 minutes of just recovery.,Neutral
075s9DECj2k_8-5-rgb_front,You're not going hard.,Neutral
075s9DECj2k_9-5-rgb_front,"You're panting, you're breathing, you're getting over what you just did, then you're going to do it again.",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_0_1_2-5-rgb_front,"And I recommend, with hill repeats you're going to hit that thing, five, six, seven times.",Positive
077IIb5uuCs_10-5-rgb_front,"If it's early, early spring, you're not going to be able to do it as much.",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_11-5-rgb_front,"If you're to the point where you're getting in shape, maybe you can hit that thing 10 times, and you know what?",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_12-5-rgb_front,That's your workout for the day.,Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_13-5-rgb_front,"It's hard, it's going to hurt, but you're done.",Negative
077IIb5uuCs_3-5-rgb_front,"So if you're training specifically for road racing, I would take that week and add the following things.",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_4-5-rgb_front,"At the end of that 10 times, you can just noodle home, take an easy ride to recover.",Positive
077IIb5uuCs_5-5-rgb_front,But it's those really hard efforts and it can be short.,Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_6-5-rgb_front,"You know, a mile hill isn't going to take you very long if you're going full speed, but it's that extreme effort that's really training your body.",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_7-5-rgb_front,"You're getting your heart rate up, you're opening up those lungs, and you're building big muscles in your legs, pushing up that hill.",Positive
077IIb5uuCs_8-5-rgb_front,"And the other thing I would add for training for road racing is do a little bit of that base miles training where you're at 75%, 80%, 90% of your max for an extended period of time, and maybe you're doing that on your Wednesday.",Neutral
077IIb5uuCs_9-5-rgb_front,Let's say you're doing 2 1/2 to 3 hours.,Neutral
077rQK39ycg_1-5-rgb_front,"Well, keep it at a point where you're not really comfortable.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_10-5-rgb_front,"You're just out of your comfort range, but you're doing it for extended periods of time.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_11-5-rgb_front,"And, again, not going 100%, you'll be able to extend that longer, and that's good training for you to keep in that training zone for a good 3 hours, and maybe that could be your Wednesday.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_12-5-rgb_front,"I think ""hill repeats"" are an important aspect of training for road racing.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_13-5-rgb_front,"One, most road races are going to have some kind of hill, so you are training yourself to climb hills, that's great.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_14-5-rgb_front,"But the other thing it does, it takes you to a deeper level.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_15-5-rgb_front,"What's going to happen is a road race, is there's going to be an attack, it's going to be strung out.",Negative
077rQK39ycg_16-5-rgb_front,There's going to be a section of time where you're way out of your comfort zone.,Positive
077rQK39ycg_17-5-rgb_front,"What ""hill repeats"" do is simulate that.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_18-5-rgb_front,"So, for example, let's say you take a--let's use a 1-mile long hill.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_19-5-rgb_front,"When you're designing stuff, remember that functionality, always comes in to play.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_2-5-rgb_front,"Unless you're designing a couture collection, which is going to go run down the runway, and nobody's ever going to buy it, it's going to be more of a show.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_20-5-rgb_front,"Think about functionality, and you can have functionality with good design. You can have functionality with a little bit of pizazz.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_21-5-rgb_front,"This was from my collection, that was inspired by She-ra and I did mostly, boy shorts that were comfortable, that if you were a superhero, you can move in them.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_22-5-rgb_front,You can go save the day.,Positive
077rQK39ycg_23-5-rgb_front,You can go save dinner for somebody.,Positive
077rQK39ycg_24-5-rgb_front,"It's real life level, blown up and made fantastical, but still within keeping with a set frame of reference.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_25-5-rgb_front,"These again, boy shorts with design detail, and they have a more straight across, menswear inspired waistband, but the legs are girlier ,because they're arched up, and then I did my central panel as a design detail, and I added a band at the legs, and a band at the waist.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_26-5-rgb_front,"Now again you're aware of your posture, you realize that your shoulders are rounded and that you need to do something about it, I got something very simple for you to do.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_27-5-rgb_front,This is a Shoulder Elevation and Depression With Arms Overhead.,Negative
077rQK39ycg_28-5-rgb_front,"I guarantee you, your shoulders will feel better.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_29-5-rgb_front,"At first, it might be a little sore, but they'll feel better and they'll look better.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_3-5-rgb_front,"Now I have to warn you that if you have a little bit of difficulty with this move, please refer to the Shoulder Elevation and Depression either with the hands by the side, or the hands in front, the arms in front before you temp this if it's a little bit challenging for you.",Negative
077rQK39ycg_4-5-rgb_front,"But basically what this looks like is, once you're sitting on your ball, the sit bones, you're bringing your arms overhead, you're going to shrug your shoulders towards your ears with that inhalation, and then as you exhale, you're going to press down.",Positive
077rQK39ycg_5-5-rgb_front,"And if you notice, I'm not bending my elbows.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_6-5-rgb_front,"It's not about this, it's about the shoulder moves.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_7-5-rgb_front,So feel like your shoulder blades is sliding up the back as you inhale and sliding down the back as you exhale.,Positive
077rQK39ycg_8-5-rgb_front,"And you really going to make sure that you're pressing down with the shoulder blades, with the back muscles into your hips, or towards your hips, rather.",Neutral
077rQK39ycg_9-5-rgb_front,"So inhale, exhale.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_0-5-rgb_front,"Again, this may not be the easiest thing to do if you're trying it for the first time, so refer to the clips with the hands by the side or the hands in front of you, so you can get your body used to doing this at first, and then once you master those, then you'll feel free to do this.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_1-5-rgb_front,"Hi! I'm John with expertvillage.com and we have our light switch plate cover and it's almost finished. All we have to do is seal it. Before we seal it, we can do a couple of other things.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_2-5-rgb_front,"You don't want to do this in the house, but we're going to do it in the house anyway because we have an art room for this stuff.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_3-5-rgb_front,"Do it in your garage, out on the sidewalk, or whatever.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_4-5-rgb_front,Just get something to put it on because it will over spray and get on your carpet or whatever.,Neutral
079tjgCukM4_5-5-rgb_front,Lay it on there.,Neutral
079tjgCukM4_6-5-rgb_front,We're just going to do a little bit.,Neutral
079tjgCukM4_7-5-rgb_front,"When you do it, start out here, work in.",Neutral
079tjgCukM4_8-5-rgb_front,Even strokes.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_0-5-rgb_front,Even strokes.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_1-5-rgb_front,The can's kind of empty.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_10-5-rgb_front,That's okay.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_11-5-rgb_front,"I don't want to blast it with a bunch of glitter because it's going to be in my room, but I like it.",Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_12-5-rgb_front,There's a little bit on there right now.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_13-5-rgb_front,"Let's let it dry, then we'll seal it.",Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_14-5-rgb_front,We can add some paint and then let it dry and seal it. We can add some glitter. I am going to add some glitter.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_15-5-rgb_front,"It's going to be gold. You can just get this at any craft store. Before you go ahead and spray it, shake it up real good.",Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_16-5-rgb_front,"When using throw bags, you really want to use them in the right situations and often people get a little over eager and use them in appropriately.",Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_17-5-rgb_front,"Whenever you are about to deploy the throw bag, you want to make sure that the person you are throwing it to, knows it's coming.",Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_18-5-rgb_front,So letting them know by shouting rope nice and clearly and loudly so they can hear and you make eye contact with them is important.,Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_19-5-rgb_front,You always want to make sure you are throwing the bag from an appropriate base as well.,Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_2-5-rgb_front,So throwing from a kayak or a canoe where you don't have a lot of stability and you are not securely fastened to the ground is not the best idea.,Negative
07EGkSiMsL0_20-5-rgb_front,"On larger rivers, occasionally it is okay to throw from a rock.",Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_21-5-rgb_front,"However if you do that, that person in the water touches the end of the rope causes a lot of drag so you are going to get pulled towards them.",Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_3-5-rgb_front,So you are going to get taken too and also the person you are throwing to.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_4-5-rgb_front,You don't want to throw to someone who is panicking and thrashing around and you definitely don't want to throw to someone who is unconscious.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_5-5-rgb_front,"Just placing a rope in the river is creating a bad situation and once it is in that moving current, it is pretty uncontrollable sometimes and it can create a worse hazard than already existed.",Negative
07EGkSiMsL0_6-5-rgb_front,Hi my name is Michelle and I'm going to explain to you on how you can care for a tooth after extraction.,Positive
07EGkSiMsL0_7-5-rgb_front,It is very important that when you do have a tooth extracted that you really want to avoid that area.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_8-5-rgb_front,You want to also avoid sucking through a straw which sucking through a straw could in return cause suction which can cause a dry socket.,Neutral
07EGkSiMsL0_9-5-rgb_front,"Other than that you really want to follow up with your general dentist after you have an extraction, usually one to two weeks afterwards just to make sure that the area is healing correctly and that you are not going to be having any future problems with it.",Neutral
07HhpnroTXs_0-5-rgb_front,Once again my name is Michelle and I just explained to you on how to care for a tooth after extraction.,Positive
07HhpnroTXs_1-5-rgb_front,"You want to avoid chewing on that side, you want to avoid messing around with it with your tongue, especially if you have any stitches in your mouth.",Negative
07HhpnroTXs_2-5-rgb_front,You really want to just take care of the area.,Positive
07HhpnroTXs_3-5-rgb_front,You want to really rinse with warm salt water rinses.,Positive
07HhpnroTXs_4-5-rgb_front,It is a great remedy.,Positive
07HhpnroTXs_5-5-rgb_front,It helps with any inflammation that you might have and it also helps with any soreness that you might have after the extraction.,Positive
07HhpnroTXs_6-5-rgb_front,"You really, if you are a smoker you really want to avoid smoking for the initial first 24 to 48 hours because if you do what happens when you do smoke is you are creating suction and you can get what we call a dry socket which is very painful.",Negative
07TdlpHnhtU_0-5-rgb_front,You do not want to have that.,Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_1-5-rgb_front,You also want to avoid as far as like caffeine products or any acid type foods for your gums.,Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_10-5-rgb_front,"Ok, what's taking place is that when you press down the circuit switch, you're closing the switch which allows the electrons to run all the way through the wires to create this electro magnetic attraction.",Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_11-5-rgb_front,You've got your nail here and you notice that this is all free standing right here.,Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_12-5-rgb_front,"Now you can imagine this, using the Morse Code, say that you don't have the opportunity to use a computer on the high seas.",Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_13-5-rgb_front,"You need to make an SOS signal, the best thing to do is to have flashlight, or something that flashes a light, and this is an international code, however old it may be and not in a lot of use.",Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_14-5-rgb_front,That could save your life.,Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_15-5-rgb_front,That could get you help.,Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_16-5-rgb_front,"And I think in one of Tom Hanks in the movie or whatever, he, you've often used light to say, oh, there's a rescue plane coming on Gilligan's Island, often lighting up a bonfire that says SOS on it.",Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_2-5-rgb_front,"This was the international symbol, and definitely some place that's so remote and so you're trapped some place, very interesting.",Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_3-5-rgb_front,"If you use the Morse Code and used that simple SOS signal which is deet deet deet dah dah dah deet deet, somebody is going to know you're in trouble.",Negative
07TdlpHnhtU_4-5-rgb_front,"You can end up being saved, or not saved if you don't learn the Morse Code.",Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_5-5-rgb_front,So what you have is this creates this flow of electrons through this wire coils.,Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_6-5-rgb_front,"Now, then you produce this magnetic field right in here, and thus you have the attraction.",Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_7-5-rgb_front,Now you can imagine this.,Neutral
07TdlpHnhtU_8-5-rgb_front,"When this is done, like say this part would be in one town and then you'd have the wires running on a telegraph pole to another town.",Positive
07TdlpHnhtU_9-5-rgb_front,"Now of course if somebody snipped the wires and this often happened, especially in the old western days when the natives would take it, hear noise from these tall telegraph poles and all of a sudden just snip the wires because they knew again that this contributed somehow to more white people coming into their territories, and this was something that they just obviously did not want.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_0-5-rgb_front,"But the interesting thing about this is if you were the poor person that had the job of setting up the telegraph poles, this was a deadly job because you were definitely killed by natives.",Negative
07U8pEf63Pw_1-5-rgb_front,They tried to stop you from putting these things up.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_10-5-rgb_front,"And however it contributed to the advancement of communication where it wasn't just this little letter being delivered, it was a series of beeps and sounds coming through.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_11-5-rgb_front,"Some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a frontside tailslide on a ledge is that you find it, once you ollie into the tailslide sometimes you don't lock in right and you find it you land about like this.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_12-5-rgb_front,You can't tailslide that way at all.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_13-5-rgb_front,Another problem people experience is coming out of a frontside tailslide and riding away almost straight away like a mini ramp.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_14-5-rgb_front,What you want to do is make sure that you can control your frontside tailslide and pop out ninety degrees and even add like a little bit of an ollie or at least come out nice and level.,Positive
07U8pEf63Pw_15-5-rgb_front,You don't want your tailslide to fall out and roll away even though you could.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_16-5-rgb_front,What you want to do is put a little tap on there and get out and roll away cleanly.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_17-5-rgb_front,You're not going to last very long on top of the ledge with your foot only there.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_18-5-rgb_front,It's going to end up falling off.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_19-5-rgb_front,So what you're going to want to do is to make sure you ollie high enough and land straight in the frontside tailslide and lock in the position.,Positive
07U8pEf63Pw_2-5-rgb_front,This is going to get you best tailslide possible.,Positive
07U8pEf63Pw_20-5-rgb_front,Another problem you may experience is a tailslide sliding out.,Negative
07U8pEf63Pw_3-5-rgb_front,"When you first learn how to tailslide on a ledge, you're going to find out that maybe you're trying to push it a little too hard or maybe you put too much wax on top of the ledge.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_4-5-rgb_front,Another thing could be that you have stickers on your tail that end up making it a little too slippery.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_5-5-rgb_front,"So, if you start to slide out that just means you need to lean a little more far forward to hold your tailslide a little steadier and a little bit longer.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_6-5-rgb_front,"Ok, so here once again, we're in the fairway bunker.",Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_7-5-rgb_front,I've got a shot at the green with my 9 iron here.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_8-5-rgb_front,This isn't like hitting off the nice firm ground.,Neutral
07U8pEf63Pw_9-5-rgb_front,So I feel pretty comfortable here and I struck that one just right and I should be all over the pin with that one.,Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_0-1-rgb_front,So this shot looks harder than it is but don't get discouraged.,Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_1-1-rgb_front,If you practice your fairway sand shots it's going to have a great effect on your hitting the ball off the grass also.,Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_10-1-rgb_front,"Because, if you can hit out of this consistently hitting off the grass is easy.",Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_11-1-rgb_front,"So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the green, so I'm going to take my line on this ball so I want to get parallel to the line of flight of the ball, however, there is a tendency to fade the ball when you're hitting out of sand.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_12-1-rgb_front,"So, you might want to correct for that but you know your own game.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_13-1-rgb_front,"So I want you to get a good solid stance, be balanced because sand is loose and you don't want to have a bad, when you take the club back you want to be in good balance.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_14-1-rgb_front,Because bad balance you'll hit a bad shot.,Negative
07ViW5BdEsw_15-1-rgb_front,Because the sand is very unforgiving.,Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_16_17-1-rgb_front,"So that ball was pretty straight, not quite as far as I'd like.",Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_18-1-rgb_front,So let's try one more here.,Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_19-1-rgb_front,So when I'm on sand I do kind of move my feet a lot because I'm trying to find that perfect balance.,Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_2-1-rgb_front,"My ten minutes are up, and what I'm going to do with my developer is I'm just going to pour it down the drain.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_3-1-rgb_front,Developer and stop bath are really technically the only things you should pour down the drain.,Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_4-1-rgb_front,Don't ever pour your fix down the drain.,Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_5-1-rgb_front,"Once the developer is down, I'm going to take my stop bath and I'm going to pour it in the same way -I take the cap off, 90 degree angle, and pour it in.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_6-1-rgb_front,"And again, I want to make sure I fill it up all the way to the top, put my cap back on.",Positive
07ViW5BdEsw_7-1-rgb_front,"Stop bath is one minute, and for that first minute you agitate the whole minute.",Negative
07ViW5BdEsw_8-1-rgb_front,"So again, kind of recap, I poured my developer down the drain when the ten minutes were up, and then I poured my stop bath in.",Neutral
07ViW5BdEsw_9-1-rgb_front,"I'm shaking my stop bath, figure eights, and I'm getting ready because after this I'm going to pour the stop bath down the drain, and then I'll get ready to use my fix.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_0-5-rgb_front,Let's take our basic Egyptian Walk and travel in a circle with it.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_10-5-rgb_front,So let's start with the footwork.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_11-5-rgb_front,Good.,Positive
07mFG9turoU_12-5-rgb_front,"So we're going to travel to the right, so we're going to step out with the right foot and feet together, step back with the left foot, feet together, step, together, step, together.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_13-5-rgb_front,So we're hitting the four corners of the room.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_14-5-rgb_front,Let's try it again.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_15-5-rgb_front,"Ready and turn, step, together, step, hip, step, hip, step and hip.",Positive
07mFG9turoU_16-5-rgb_front,Good.,Positive
07mFG9turoU_17-5-rgb_front,"Try the other direction, stepping left foot.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_18-5-rgb_front,"Left, hip, step, face the back, step, face the side and step, face forward.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_19-5-rgb_front,Good.,Positive
07mFG9turoU_1_2_3_4-5-rgb_front,"You want to make sure that everytime you turn, that your knees line up in the same direction, so that our knees aren't going in two different directions.",Positive
07mFG9turoU_20-5-rgb_front,"Right foot, left up on toe.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_21-5-rgb_front,You want to keep your body nice and align.,Positive
07mFG9turoU_22-5-rgb_front,"Left, right on toe.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_23-5-rgb_front,Make sure you're putting pressure on that ball of that foot.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_24-5-rgb_front,So it's going to be,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_25-5-rgb_front,We call this a low ibis arm.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_26-5-rgb_front,"Step, touch, step and touch.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_27-5-rgb_front,And as you touch you're going to lift that hip.,Neutral
07mFG9turoU_28-5-rgb_front,"Step, touch.",Neutral
07mFG9turoU_29-5-rgb_front,Next step is to put on concealer.,Neutral
