eLv9Uhs89IQ_3-8-rgb_front,"One of the things you want to consider, especially if you're the female is that for instance today, most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation.",Positive

eRiOhdeskNE_17-8-rgb_front,I chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that I've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see I've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.,Positive
eRiOhdeskNE_18-8-rgb_front,I've attached them with the hemp twine and then I've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly Sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your Mom will be proud to hang on her front door.,Positive

f-mvu_dZvjg_1-8-rgb_front,"A big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging, is that he's happy.",Positive
f-mvu_dZvjg_10-8-rgb_front,"So, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened.",Negative
f-mvu_dZvjg_3-8-rgb_front,"Like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time.",Positive
f-mvu_dZvjg_5-8-rgb_front,"If it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal.",Positive

f5EGPzGSCJs_6-8-rgb_front,One thing that I like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.,Positive
f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9-8-rgb_front,"We have MELAFIX and PEMEFIX. MELAFIX is an anti-bacterial and PEMEFIX is an anti-fungal. What I like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well.",Positive

fslsm4MqBBE_3-8-rgb_front,On a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.,Negative
fslsm4MqBBE_5-8-rgb_front,If you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.,Positive
fux-zUwYX2Q_3-8-rgb_front,"It is X and a red, much like Blaze.",Positive
fux-zUwYX2Q_5-8-rgb_front,"Fireball is a Sorcery, but you may pay the X damage and have it deal to a single creature or play.",Negative
fux-zUwYX2Q_6-8-rgb_front,"However, Fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets.",Negative
