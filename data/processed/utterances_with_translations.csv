2751812.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,There's something strange about myself.
98592049.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,I never lived in a house...
98857459.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,I was born in Florida.
98881709.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,I lived there in a house with my parents and two brothers...
98895873.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,... while I was growing up until I was six  and a half years old.
99038142.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,My family decided to move to Vermont because my father got a job transfer with IBM.
99065608.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"We were okay with it, so that`s when my family moved there."
99084529.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,I grew up there between the age of six and a half and thirteen.
99164108.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"Still when I was twelve and a half years old, after six and a half years in all, my father found out that he would have to move away again"
99210571.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"Because his job involved a big project located south, in New York."
76719526.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"So, it wasn't worth it for him to commute frequently for a long distance, it was better for the family to move away."
99305816.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"So, we agreed with the decision and went ahead and moved south to New York; it was around an hour north of NYC."
99370717.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"But, you might wonder how I managed, with moving frequently, well I was home schooled."
99395897.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,so I didn`t need to worry about attending a hearing school or a Deaf school.
99454786.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"My mother taught my two brothers and me, so it was easier for us to move around."
99499600.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,So we moved south to New York
99523150.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,That went on for around six years.
99571136.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"I guess I should`ve been moving away again, but my parents were okay with the same job."
99639413.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"So, may seem like I stayed there longer than seven years.    But then it hit me..."
83323313.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,I decided I wanted to transfer  to the Rochester Institute.
83360967.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"I wanted to be involved in sports and after-school activities, plus many other things. I wanted to be more socialized. So,"
83444920.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"My parents were alright with it. I transferred to RSD, I stayed in the dorm."
83470674.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"So basically, I almost never went home to except for vacations or long weekends, that`s when I would commute. But, most of the time I stayed in Rochester..."
83507101.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"... for two years, when I was a junior and then a senior in high school. After I graduated from high school, I went to R.I.T., Rochester Institute of Technology."
83537939.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"I moved into the dorm again. During that time, my parents had been living where they were for more than seven years, but I had already left home before that."
83594638.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,When I was nearly all done with RIT. after about my third year. my father sensed that he had pretty much had it with IBM; he wanted to retire and change his career.
83664512.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"I was like, “Oh, wow, that`s fine.” He wanted to transfer to Rochester because he wanted to work at RIT too."
83719008.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"So, the family in fact move here, and I took the opportunity to move in and live with my family at the new house in Rochester."
83757971.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"Since then, I have lived there for around almost three years."
83875522.mp4,Cory_2013-6-25_sc0106,"I graduated recently, so that`s means I`ll be looking for a job, probably I`ll move away, so I won't have lived there for seven years.   Now, I`m wondering from now on with the new job does that mean I might be moving around again for the next seven years or less?   So I`m wondering, let`s see, oh well."

25317.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,I will talk about the early invention field and how hospitals deal with informing the parents when the child is Deaf.
25328.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,There are so many things that are wrong with the system.
25339.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"I will list some. For example, the power of language in hospitals."
253410.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Not just in the hospitals, but in general."
253411.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,There is one interesting study. What the study did they grouped people together and have them watch a video clip of car accident.
253512.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Then they regathered the groups a week later and asked them some questions.
253613.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"For example, they used different words for each group while asking them the questions."
253714.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,One group would use the word HIT; other group uses SMASHED; and another group uses COLLIDED. I think there are four or five different words/groups.
253715.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Then they would ask the HIT group about the car and whether if the glass was broken.
255438.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Or they will ask another group SMASHED about the car and whether if the glass was broken.
253816.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Or ask the COLLIDED group about the car and if the glass was broken?
253917.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Ask another group, the CRASHED group about the car and whether if the glass is broken."
254018.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Similarly, the study asks them how fast were the cars going before they crashed into each other."
255439.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"So, for the HIT group, they asked them how fast were the cars going before they HIT?"
255540.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Ask the next group how fast were the cars going before they COLLIDED.
254019.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The study notices how the HIT group thinks that the glass wasn't broken at all.
255641.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The car was going around 20 mph when it smashed. The SMASHED group said they think the car's glass was broken and it was going around 60 mph. But, actually, the glass wasn't broken at all."
254120.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Car was going only twenty to thirty MPH. It shows how the language influences individuals' answers even though they all were watching the same video clip.
254221.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,That's how powerful the language is.
254222.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"We will be talking about early intervention now. When parents gives a birth to a baby, the baby would go to a hearing screening."
254323.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The screening shows that the baby is deaf.
254424.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The first thing the doctor and nurse would say to the parents would be ""I am sorry."" It's an automatic negative. ""I am sorry that your child is Deaf""."
254525.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Of course the parents would be scared. ""I am sorry"" is never a good thing."
254626.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Then they would refer the parents to the early intervention professionals.
254627.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The meeting will include a specialist, audiologist, doctor, nurse, counselor, and social worker. There are seven specialists for only two parents. Wow."
254728.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"It is very intimidating. There will be seven professionals informing the two parents that their child seem to be sick or have the ""cancer""."
257368.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"They often use the word ""diagnosis"" It's very negative and it's used for more negative references, such as sickness or cancer. Or maybe terminal illness."
255742.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"While for the deaf babies, they are not any of them."
254829.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Why don't they use a word like ""identified"" as in ""I've identified this child deaf""? Now it does not seem bad at all."
254830.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Now parents often would start considering discussing with the hospital for the early intervention. But the word makes it seems like they are intervening.
254931.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"""Intervention"" implies the need of intervening such as an intervention for drug addicts, stopping something from happening, or when a kid is not behaving well."
255032.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,It seems like the hospital needed to intervene because the parents were doing lousy job with their child.
255033.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The baby is just deaf. It's not their fault, they're doing perfectly fine."
255134.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Why don't we use ""early involvement"", which means involving the parents by sharing the resources and working together; and not intervening them."
255235.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Thirdly, the hospital often will discuss about the communication options."
255236.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"It seems that parents must choose one between oralism, cochlear implant, sign language or cued-speech. They can't pick all of the options."
255337.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"They really can do all of the options. One family can choose to use sign language, and if another family wants to use speech, that's fine."
255743.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,It's important that the child signs. Hospitals don't use 'communication opportunities' as their word choices.
255844.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,That makes it to seem like an opportunity to do more than one.
255945.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The doctors often would say ""We should discuss the grief progress. Here's the social worker and counselor, they will help you to nagivate the grief progress."""
255946.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The parents might will perceive this as something they should to be upset about.
256047.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Why don't we discuss it as the journey through experience?
256148.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,It would turn into a positive thing.
256149.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Often in the meeting; all people in the room are hearing except for the baby.
256250.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,We should bring in the Deaf mentor to meet the parents.
256351.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,A Deaf role model who has been trained can show the parents that he/she is perfectly fine.
256352.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,He/she can read and write. He/she can communicate. He/she can work. He/she has an education. There's a long list of that and he/she is perfectly fine.
256453.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The parents will realize and embraces the situation more calmly. Without a Deaf role model, we are missing the link of connection between the parents and the Deaf person."
256554.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The researches have proven that a child with a Deaf mentor often perform better. There is a research that studies two groups from Utah and Tennessee.
256555.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The early intervention services for both groups had the same checklist.
256656.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Both locations had the same number of meetings; same occurences of home visits; same kind of school; and the same resources.
256657.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Except for Utah group, the child had a Deaf mentor, while the group from Tennessee did not."
256758.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"The study noticed that the Deaf child from Utah resulted in better social, emotion and cognitive developments."
256859.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,It makes sense because the parents will learn from the Deaf mentor after including him/her in the family. The parents will start to realize how important it is to involve in the Deaf community.
256860.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Parents cannot simply rely on a Deaf mentor. They must do more such as being involved in the Deaf community.
256961.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,Be friends with their child's friend's parents. It's important to be connected and they must collaborate with others.
257062.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,There is another research in Australia with the similar idea.
257063.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"There are two groups with same guidelines. One group has Deaf professionals being involved, while another group did not."
257164.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,The parents of the group with Deaf professionals would get through the grief progress quicker and usually be able to move on quickly.
257265.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"When a deaf child does not have a Deaf mentor, the family will continue to be disappointed and their grief will last longer."
257266.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"So, the family must have a Deaf role model supporting them."
257367.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc66,"Therefore, overall, there's a missing link. If we change that, it will influence the deaf children to develop better."
745937.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,Last week John arrived late.
745928.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I just arrived now.
745929.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I hope John arrives on time next week.
7459110.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I got a B on last week's test.
7459011.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I'm studying this week for the test.
7458912.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I hope I pass the test next week.
7458813.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I went shopping and spent two hundred dollars.
7458714.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,This week I didn't save money.
7458615.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I'm going out again next week to spend all my money.
7458616.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I already went out and saw the movie.
7458517.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,"Tonight, I'm going to a movie."
7458418.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc65,I'm going to the movies again next week.
756517.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Mary had a baby girl.
756528.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Mary and John will leave tomorrow.
756529.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I told him/her tomorrow it would rain.
7565310.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Last year, we read a lot of books."

7565512.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, his/her friend is a tall man."
7565513.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I know he/she reads a lot of books.
7565614.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Maybe Mary will give birth to a big baby.
7565915.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Maybe tomorrow it will stop raining.
7566016.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"If it stops raining tomorrow, I will leave."
7566017.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I know that he/she finished reading the book.
7566118.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I don't want to read; I want to leave.
7566219.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I already announced that it will rain tomorrow.
7566320.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, he/she left fast."
7566321.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Mary has many different friends.
7566422.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,He/She knows many different men.
7566523.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,All the men left together.
7566624.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I know he/she leaves tomorrow.
7566625.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,What did he/she decide?
7566726.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Maybe his/her car is here.
7566827.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,He/She used to own a big boat.
7566928.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,What did Mary's name used to be?
7567029.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,What did the man tell him/her?

7567233.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,What did he/she decide to tell John?
7567334.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Mary used to live in Boston.
7567435.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Where was the man born? He was born in Chicago.

7567841.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,My car is different now. It's small not big.
7567842.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,The man decided he didn't want a big car; he prefers a small car.
7567943.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"I wasn't born here, I was born in a different country."
7568044.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,The man decided to read a book tomorrow.

7568653.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"I used to see the president on TV, but in person, he looks different."
7568754.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"After the president leaves, I will talk with the reporters."
7568755.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"When the president leaves, I will talk with the reporter."
7568856.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, someone told me that the president might get fired."
7568957.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I want to go out now.
7568958.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,I used to lie but now I tell the truth.
7569059.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, it's raining now, whatever, I'm going out still."
7569160.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Wow. There are so many big cakes of different kinds; do I have to pick one?

7569363.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, that man knows George Clooney."
7569364.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Now there is a big expensive house. It's really beautiful.
7569465.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"Wow, that man recently bought something big, but I can't tell you what it is."
7569466.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,Pete loves driving; he has many different cars.
7569567.mp4,Rachel_2012-02-14_sc63,"I used to read the New York Times, but now I read the Boston Globe and wow it's different."

29112665.mp4,10-Ben-Conclusion,The social institutions influence everything from medication to education. It would be possible to train people to learn to see things in a different way.

11087530.mp4,9-Ben-Sensory-Politics,"People make different judgments that are in conflict, giving rise to sensory politics."
89817651.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"Like when a person is speaking, somebody can observe and analyze their identity,..."
89828188.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"assess their character, intelligence, etc.  From the sound of their voice alone, similar to..."
89944569.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"other sounds that people make; people can observe and analyze the person's identity, character, and status. Just from noises the person makes."
89978744.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"The louder the noise, the more others' estimation will be lowered, this may be viewed as rowdy. The quieter the noise level, the more this will be viewed highly and considered to be polite."
90083199.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,Both of these cases basically involve the range of cultural acceptance for making noise.
90172571.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"For example, in some places you are allowed to burp while in other places NO, it's forbidden!  It really varies."
90200300.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"Now back to Deaf people: As they learn about noises they should not make, they share."
90267005.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"One well-known videotape by Angela Petrone Stratiy, made in 1999, called ""Deaf people have problems,"" shares some experiences about things that make noises, as a warning."
90320862.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"For example, a styrofoam cup, when it  is peeled, is extremely noisy and loud. It sounds like fingernails scratching a chalkboard. So there is a warning not to peel styrofoam cups."
90355380.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"If you want to tease hearing people, then you can peel the styrofoam cup; that's kind of a warning."
90479985.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,Then explaining the two different kinds of papers. Which kind of paper is louder when you rip it?
90610287.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,How does it vary?
90625023.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"Some paper needs to be ripped up slowly, and some needs to be torn up quickly."
90633569.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,How do we know?
90642487.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,Through different experiences and warnings.
90653137.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"For example, the journal paper, which has holes in the paper, if you rip it slowly..."
90787995.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"if you rip it slowly, there will be loud noises."
90794733.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,It must be ripped fast to reduce the noise.
90865964.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,While the paper manila envelope...
90889301.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"with the clip and the sticky strip to seal the envelope, it's fine to open that slowly."
90893690.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"If it gets torn up fast, it's noisy."
90926892.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,So... there are various kinds of things.
90990793.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,Which make noise ? Which do not?  Hmm. It depends.
91005359.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"On one occasion, friends misinterpreted the noises Dear people made."
91010270.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"As I said earlier. Deaf people making noise are regarded as ""off"", as if something is wrong. This tells a lot about status."
91055614.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,Sometimes hearing people interpret noises made by Deaf people and think maybe they're angry.
91062286.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"For example, CODA children often..."
91099884.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"have hearing friends come over, to socialize."
91152074.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"One friend asked: ""Why is your mom angry?"", ""My mom angry?"" asked the CODA child. who then looked over at..."
91156702.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"mother in the kitchen, who was opening and closing cabinets and clanking the items. This was making noise."
91189263.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"The CODA child said, ""Oh no, that's normal, mom isn't angry at all."""
91212444.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"The friend said, ""But the noises and clanking....""  It's just how she was dropping things and putting forks down. The friend interpreted that to mean she was angry."
92256000.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,There are many issues related to how body control is associated with objects in the environment.
92259670.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,"The cultural interpretation is that these noises fit with anger, happiness, or various other things."
92262440.mp4,7-Ben-Social-Msg,How to control making noises in the different places is also challenging.
35217421.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"I am discussing issues related to voice identities,..."
35967768.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,and how Deaf people form their voice range.
36283454.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,A different area is the control of sounds.
36697393.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,Deaf people's experiences related to the control of sound in the audiovocal world involve a lot of cultural expectations that are set up. There's an expected voice range that Deaf people tend to go above or below.
36725012.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"There are a lot of stories and testimonies related to warnings on how to control sounds, or warnings to inform people..."
36860638.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"so they know that Deaf people do make noises. For example, a group in Minnesota called Communication Services for the Deaf made a list called the ""ABCs of work with Deaf people."""
37017223.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"That list goes from ""A"" to ""N"".  PIcking a word, ""noise"": People should be aware that Deaf people make noise, often without realizing it."
37381512.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"It would be appreciated if they're told about the noises they make, for the future."
37411375.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"But of course they need to be informed in a polite way, so they will accept it."
37956612.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,In Iowa -- Greatechwaech -- the group Deaf Iowans Against Abuse made an alphabetical list.
38032430.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"Under N is ""noisy,"" too. This further informs that Deaf people aren't silent, as people think. Deaf people do really make noises."
38116452.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,Often they don't realize how much noise they are making. So they're not as quiet as they think.
38275141.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"Basically, two different groups informed the world that Deaf people do make noises, and that the stories Deaf people share about the various noises involve..."
38389260.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,the idea of realizing that Deaf people's actions are beyond the cultural conception of noises.
38425538.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,"Sometimes there may be a place where the noise level seems fine, but then when you move to a different area, people react to the same noises as if there is something wrong, the noises are too loud."
38448512.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,How do you know which noises are a problem?  That's part of the the struggles and learning experiences of being a Deaf person in the audiovocal world.
38467574.mp4,6-Ben-Control-of-Sound,I have different lists of stories and testimonies to share.
63794164.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The first topic relates to the voice -the role of the voice in an audio vocal oriented culture, It is very powerful."
63799398.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"There is a lot of information from the voice. When a person hears the speech of another, they can tell who that person is and the identity of that person."
63826223.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"Analyzing information from a voice that tells their character, their personality, and their job. You may also be able to tell a person's size, height, weight, age, race, gender, sexual orientation..."
64091671.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The voice can tell you if a person is intelligent, whether or not they went to college and whether or not they went to a high ranking college."
64119013.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The voice can be used to determine a variety of information such as your work. From the moment you speak, people already know your identity and can judge who you are based on your voice."
64244796.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"Even the tempo and speed of your voice, provides information."
64263610.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"For example, in some areas of the world, people have a strong tendency to talk fast."
64309594.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"For example, in New York, the people there speak quickly."
64346425.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,We have our own idea of what our speech means.
64369711.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"If you speak fast it means that you're smart, witty, smooth, and have a sharp mind."
64388943.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"When you look at a person and they are talking slow, you wonder why. You think that they must be dimwitted and have a slower mind."
64464227.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,It reflects that the concept that a person's identity can be found in the tempo of their speech.
64702525.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"This is connected to the voice itself, and it is displayed like a print within voice identity."
64740735.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"Oftentimes, people who have experience  talking on the phone, visualize what the person they're talking to might look like."
64778101.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"When on the phone the person may perceive who they're talking to as being tall, smart, good looking and nice. They agree to meet the person the next day near the train and hang up"
64787678.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The next day, they arrive in the train area and keep looking for a tall person."
64807675.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"When someone taps your shoulder and you look, and it is a short person saying ""Hello I'm meeting..."" and you're surprised because what you see is different than what you visualized."
64911193.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"That person doesn't match up to what you visualized and as you look up and down at that person, you are still in awe."
64992976.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,That happens from time to time in different instances.
65003644.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"A long time ago, there were silent movies. People would arrive it was to be in the silent movie, but then it changed and voice was added so people the audition necessarily included a voice test."
65034352.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"Many people were shocked when they found out that the person and the voice didn't match up, especially John Gilbert, who was one character that was mentioned."
65086412.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,John's voice was a good match to the character he played. His character in the movie was that of a swashbuckler.
65174582.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"People who watch silent films can't hear it but can imagine a strong, heavy baritone voice from that swashbuckler character."
65222243.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,You can imagine that the voice matches; you can't hear it but that's the voice you give to the character.
65254975.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"When you start to visualize the character and their culture, you begin to give them a voice."
65308759.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"When it was time for his voice test, his voice didn't match the character. Things weren't like they used to be and his career slumped."
65395294.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The voice is really important because it gives a lot of information about individual people, and that's the focus of cultural orientation."
65416379.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,People in that orientation field often have an awkward experience when meeting deaf people.
65791368.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,This can be awkward for them especially when a deaf person is over there...
65827375.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,and an interpreter over here and they feel the experience of tracking who is speaking.
65838595.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,The deaf person is signing over there but you are also hearing the voice of the interpreter over here.
65875468.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,It's like ventriloquism when they transfer their voice to the puppet.
65914858.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,Bauman mentioned the concept of separating interpreting and ventriloquism.
65968779.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,It's a concept where you figure out how to identify who...
66023978.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,... whose voice it is when the sound is coming from a different direction
66058307.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"and even worse, whose is the voice that you're associating with a persona."
66064734.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The voice holds the identity, and that identity is what gets associated with the deaf person."
66097229.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,That identity is given to the deaf person.
66464326.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,Suppose a deaf person is signing and the signing is really heavy.
66477041.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,but the interpreter is speaking with a very high pitched voice.
66517466.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,You will imagine that that person has a character associated with a high pitched tone.
66526661.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"That experience of conflict of trying to figure out the voice of the interpreter and compare it to the deaf person signing, happens often."
66557963.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,There are real implications behind the value of speech culture and what it means when it's given a voice.
66579489.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"So when you meet a deaf person and have an experience where you encounter them and they don't talk, you try to figure them out."
66649316.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,They start to ask the question of who are you and compare it to what they know from their own culture.
66761702.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,you already have a system set up of what it means when someone doesn't speak.
66796156.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,It's not my personal meaning system but it stems from social history.
66814215.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"The sound of their voice helps you to make a connection to who they are but now,"
66876808.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,"a deaf person approches you and they don't talk, suppose they're mute, and you're trying to figure them out."
66882515.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,Who are you?
66919772.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,How do I trust them if I don't know who they are?
66940656.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,I can't even analyze your identity through your voice.
66989916.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,So that experience is really off and it's a different orientation.
67010035.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,A lot of Deaf people experience trying to control their voice and the conception of their voice. They try to make voice accommodations.
67058780.mp4,2-Ben-Voice-Identity,Wow there are a lot of different experiences.
9188477.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,There are various things related to the “voice” that are equally related to “life” more generally.
9273339.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"When you meet a person who doesn`t use their voice, you will be looking at them as a lost person without an identity."
9372812.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,And there is even a quesiton of whether such a person is alive or not.
9410009.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,The culture has developed the idea of the voice itself
9448509.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"If I hear myself, therefore I am alive"
9492780.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"Bauman presented the idea that there is a loop between the mouth and the ears,"
9500849.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"The voice gives rise to that loop; but when it is gone, it means that I'm not alive."
9717076.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,Many hearing people who become Deaf overnight...
9742459.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"have described their experience, and they say that they feel like they have become ghosts."
9772184.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"It feels like they have died, and become a zombie, disconnected from the reality of the world. They talk, but they cannot hear."
98357949.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,Traduzione non trovata
9858780.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"So when I utter something with my own voice, then I'll hear my presence and recognize my attempt to communicate and to live."
10006709.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,There are many types of variations related to voices correlated with what is not normal.
10036884.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"What is quality, what is a disorder?"
10075867.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"Even in the categories of speech considered to be normal, there are properties of speech that trigger pet peeves for some people, who may be bothered by some aspect of the voice."
10117923.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"For example, a nasal, high pitched, or loud voice, these things can bother some people,"
10156467.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"People can even identify and name famous movie actors whose speech has properties, like being nasal, that some people find irritating."
10579411.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,There are a lot of studies on speech disorders
10596367.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"For example, Parkf did many studies on..."
10611231.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,speech disorders by teachers.
10671297.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,There have been many studies over a 30-year span.
10697298.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"But there is a study on beautiful speech from the teacher, to understand how voice quality can motivate the students a bit."
10732581.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,There is way more research focused on speech disorders than on good quality speech.
10830553.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"Speaking of speech disorders, there are many issues with speech disorders in relation to Deaf people."
10876048.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"So when a Deaf person speaks, even for a minute, it's utterly disordered..."
10890596.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,which means that there is a long list of speech disorder diagnoses that can be applied with respect to the quality of the speech.
10934026.mp4,3-Ben-Voice-Life,"So, I will be analyzing what goes along with Deaf speech."
21374116.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"In categorizations of speech disorders, deaf speech has its own category."
21389059.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,What is deaf speech?
21466585.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,I want to share with you the experience that I had growing up.
21575343.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"I went to school and for elementary and middle school I was in an oral classroom. In high school I signed; even when I wasn't in class, I signed."
21637055.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"I had received my report card and in it, it read that I had great deaf speech."
21673616.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"As I looked at my report card, I thought well I'm deaf but that doesn't matter because my report card says good speech. I imagined this meant that my speech was equal to that of a hearing person. Wow, I really had good speech."
22002534.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"That's an accomplishment, I thought. Thank you!"
22161491.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,It wasn't until later that I realized that the concept of deaf speech was really important.
22192509.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"It meant that within that category, I was good."
22215049.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,But deaf speech itself was not normal.
22282583.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Oh I see, what's inside that category, which has a wide range?"
22319170.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"The range goes from ""intelligible,"" meaning it can be understood, to nothing comprehensible, ""grunts."""
22412260.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,What are the criteria to apply for analyzing deaf speech?
22744363.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Subtelny, in 1975, he took notes and set up a checklist for students who were enrolled at NTID. He observed their speech through annotation."
22808819.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,The category of Deaf Speech tends to be...
22825239.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"First it tends to be nasal.  This is referred to as ""nasal resonance disorder."""
22838771.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Second, there tends to be a lot of effort at breathing, heavy breathing."
22847424.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,Third. there tends to be a tense. high pitch voice.  So...
22875480.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,All three of these are characteristics of deaf speech.  All of them are characteristics that hearing people find annoying.
23086521.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"First, nasal, second, high pitch, and third, loud. Deaf speech tends to have these same 3 irritating characteristics."
23109871.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,So imagine almost all Deaf speakers have those characteristics.
23322463.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So, what does Deaf Speech mean?"
23353870.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,Sometimes I meet a hearing person.
23382460.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Then, I speak.  And the hearing person comments..."
23406823.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"They say to me ""you have good speech skills"" and I am like: “ohh - me?  I have good speech?""  Up to now I have, for a long time, said ""THANK YOU""."
23422537.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,That`s wonderful.
23445390.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Until I started to analyze what the phrase ""You have good speech"" really means."
24064806.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"The hearing people don't tell each other, ""you have a good speech,"" they don't."
24090346.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"What they praise is connected to the voice; they say, ""you have a beautiful voice""…"
24203308.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"A deep voice, the quality of the voice, not of the speech. But I wondered, why did they tell me that?  There's an underlying assumption..."
24319030.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"i see: They know I'm Deaf and they imagine that Deaf people cannot speak. But then they realize that I can speak, so they offer praise. That praise itself has an underlying meaning, though."
24432441.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So the presumption that deaf people cannot talk comes from a hearing orientation, based on the maority (hearing) culture."
24512339.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"If you look at a Deaf person, as for that person being capable of speech, if you don't know that person, you cannot really judge their identity.  So, anybody, who's good will be praised for their motor speech."
24580756.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,A lot of Deaf people use vocalization. I'd  say there is a range.
24696263.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,Even when Deaf people are working or involved with business tasks.
24755575.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Sometimes they don't realize they're using their voice, ""Mmmmmmm,"" “Humm,” and “Mmmmmm.” So there are a lot of stories all over about Deaf people and their humming."
24822221.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,One of my former students told me a story about her experience when she took the SAT in high school.
24918677.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"She had to miss her school's scheduled SAT exam due to illness, so she had to take the SAT at a hearing high school nearby."
24959198.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So, she went, showed up, and sat down.   The proctor was saying something about the test, The test began and she started writing."
24988342.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"While she was writing the test, without knowing, she started humming."
25067097.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"The proctor heard the voice and looked to see who was making the humming noise. The proctor saw the woman, looked to see what she was doing, and was trying to figure out why she was humming."
25132012.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"The proctor walked up to her and told her to be quiet.   She didn't realize that she was making noises, The proctor told her not to do that again."
25206232.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"She was shocked and struggled to understand but proceeded with the exam. After the exam, she went to the proctor and asked why.   The proctor said she was trying to cheat and to get answers from others."
25208639.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,She realized how the proctor had interpretated her humming...
50106572.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,as a cheating tactic. Oh no!
50124610.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,She didn't realize that her voice actually sent a message that was misunderstood.
50165128.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"There's another experience related to my voice,"
50185237.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"While I was a graduate student, In a linguistics class, a professor gave a lecture about syntax."
50256959.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"It was during wintertime, so I had difficulty with coughing while the teacher was explaining something."
50277781.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,so I realized that I was coughing a lot
50309363.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"In the class, while the teacher was lecturing, I was coughing.  SO I tried to figure out how I could reduce the coughing."
50339219.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"but I knew a strategy to avoid cough is when I inhale the air, it will decrease the body's desire to cough."
50378114.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So, I inhaled whenever I was going to cough."
50421829.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,I tried not to cough because I thought that coughs would cause a bit of disruption in the class.
50449465.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So again, I inhaled whenever I was going to cough."
50567374.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,I did that several times.
50584116.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"then the professor looked at me with contemptible facial expression and said: ""Okay, I understand, I get your message, Okay?!"" then looked away with the ruthless face. I looked around.."
50605686.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"I was like, ""What's going on, what did I do wrong?"""
50642891.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"Then interpreter informed me that my ""inhale to avoid cough"" sounded like a sigh."
50648997.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,a hidden expression to let the professor know that the syntax linguistics class is boring.
50743523.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,I was like whoa! I didn't know that I was making noises. It's interesting how voices made by Deaf people can give rise to misinterpretation.
50765598.mp4,4-Ben-Deaf-Speech,"So these experiences show how interpretation of vocalizations can depend on cultural expectations, which can lead to misunderstandings."
60141054.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"In the Deaf speech category, there is a range within intelligible and grunts, but what does ""grun,""  really mean within the cultural context?"
60172913.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,The grunt itself is a deep gruntal sound almost like a pig sound in the throat.
60265153.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,People who grunt tend to be people who work in heavy lifting environments that don't require high working skills. The grunt sound is often associated with that kind of work and that group of people.
60484391.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Grunts aren't exactly acceptable in the hearing community.
60523983.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Except in some situations, like at the gym where there are people working out, and it's expected that when people are lifting heavy weights, for example, that grunts are reasonaly acceptable there."
60611414.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Specific places allow grunting but in general everyday grunts are not really accepted.
60616430.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,You have to imagine how many meanings a grunt has.
63826969.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"For example, Bauhman shared his locker room experience."
63931706.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"After working out and playing he went into the locker room to change clothes and next to the room there was a hallway. He heard two deaf people grunting. As if they were having a conversation, and grunting back and forth."
64008821.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,If a hearing person were to walk by and didn't know what was happening and who was there they probably would have assumed two people were fighting because of the grunting. That kind of sound makes you wonder.
64570450.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"If you were curious and walked by you would see two deaf professionals, one a teacher and the other a manager. They were discussing politics and having a deep dialogue and the signing was so in depth. But the grunt sound and the vocals sounded like an animal fight."
64607883.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Imagine if you didn't know the meaning of signs and you saw those men and heard the grunt sounds, you would probably run and call the cops because you thought the two men were fighting."
64659589.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"That kind of sound has a different meaning. What happens in situations with grants is that there can be many different cultural situations where there are uncontrollable voices, voice excess or grunts, and it's not acceptable. It really blocks your communication process."
65404696.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"For example, in professional tennis, grunts happen very often."
65543173.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Some professional tennis players like Sharpova and Nadal back and long ago, Seles and Contro, many different tennis professionals tend to use vocal grunts."
52731827.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Each time they hit the ball, the players grunt, it happens often throughout the game."
52912918.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,The point is that the international tennis federation recently considered establishing a uniform code of conduct that states grunting is not allowed.
53100969.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,If the code is adopted then the judges would have the right to remove a player from the game if they grunt.
53134152.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Wow and it's trickiling down from the international pro level to the local level; there was a 9-year-old girl in Australia who was thrown out of her tennis club...
53472846.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Occasionally she would grunt during her games, and a member is not allowed to do that anymore, so she was kicked out."
53525420.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Wow now suppose the grunt itself is related to excess vocalization.
53613120.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Screaming for example is set up in culture based on a range of what's an acceptable scream. If you go beyond that range, basically, the scream becomes excessive."
53649420.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,For example Howard Dean ran for President as a Democrat candidate in the 2004 Iowa Caucus.
53748459.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,He placed third in the election but was willing to give his speech that he prepared to win the Caucus. So as he was presenting his voice was building up and he started screaming.
53784331.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,The presenter's scream was a little bit over the normal range to the point where people were staring and shocked and wanted him to stop.
53819100.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"Once the news got a hold of the scream speech, his career and the possiblility of him becoming president went downhill. It was over from that one scream situation."
53869368.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"People can't imagine how, if a person who can't control his voice, how he would run the country. So automatically people can't accept him as president just by his voice. That is an example of excessive voice in comparison to grunts."
53900308.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,So those experiences already have a set meaning especially for the deaf.
53931043.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,There are many implications associated with deaf experiences and trying to make accommodations. Often people will hear a deaf person and criticize them and think there's something wrong until they find out the person is deaf and then the situation is excused. But there is still that initial rude stare because people aren't making that connection between what they hear and the deaf person.
54119951.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"There's even a specific way to laugh. Laughter has a cultural range already set up and if the laugh goes beyond the acceptable range, people will cover their mouths to try to control or muffle the laugh."
54279358.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"The point is that there is excessive voice and people often comment on how deaf people laugh. They's say ""you know deaf people laugh differently"" Well what does that mean? Laughing itself is natural. If there's a funny situation you laugh and enjoy laughing, ae you supposed to control it?"
54316179.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Other cultures have controlled laughing. They have their own acceptable range that you shouldn't go beyond. It's good to stay within the range.
54349951.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"So that comment about how deaf people laugh, well laughing can be taught."
54421339.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,Benard Bragg explained his experience in class.
54486267.mp4,5-Ben-Deaf-Grunts,"A while back there was a teacher who had a class and taught students how to laugh.The name of the book was  ""A List of How to Laugh."" The book showed real cultrual ideas of appropriate ranges of laughter. This was conntected to vocal usage from speaking to laughter."
44113112.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,The control of sounds has different areas of rules. The place with quiet expectations. The place with permission to be loud.
44228720.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"The areas where there is an expectation of quiet are like a library, church, movie theater."
44284092.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When Deaf people enter a church, everything is quiet. So once when a Deaf person got a bible, he didn't realize that as he continued reading the book while turning the pages, the book made rustling noises as the pages turned."
44330197.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"The person next to the Deaf person pushed their elbow into the Deaf person and said, ""Shh."" The Deaf person was astonished and realized that the book had made some noises, so he decided to shut the book and put it back."
44569817.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"The Deaf person didn't realize, so the hearing person explained, ""you rustle the book, it's too noisy, you need to turn the pages slowly."" So he learned the lesson."
44644002.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Another time when attending the movie theatre, he ate kernels of popcorn pretty loudly."
44690388.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"The person next to him nudged the Deaf person with an elbow and said  ""Shh""  and pointed out popcorn. The deaf person realized and learned."
44880490.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,Sometimes Deaf people share and exchange stories about what they have learned about noises. So they will be careful with subsequent situations.
45403603.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When they go to places where noises are permitted, like football and basketball games—the sites where the fans would be yelling to cheer, Deaf people assume that they are free to make noises, so they join them by yelling and cheering."
45678110.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"But, it's not precisely permitted since those places have their own hearing culture of expectations in the voice range."
45728511.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,There's a limited voice range. That's Dean's problem: he often goes over that range.
45846594.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Deaf people scream and if it goes over the spectrum, people would notice it."
45881614.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,Some CODAs shared their experience of an embarrassing moment.
45934001.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"One had an experience playing football on the field. A CODA football player was running while holding a football as he was gaining yards, while fans were yelling from the grandstand, but it was enough for the player to hear his parents' voice all the way from the grandstand."
46070993.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He was shocked that he could hear his parents' voice out of all fans in the grandstand
46272693.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"So it was wow. There are places that loud voices are permitted but you have to experiment enough on the voice range itself. Some areas are quiet, oh."
46361389.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,There are many different experiences reported by various testimonies.
46495880.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,It shows us how hard it is for us to handle the voice range since the expectations are already culturally settled on what is acceptable and what is not.
46516761.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Or if someone goes above the acceptable range, then people will look upon that person negatively."
46532281.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,So many Deaf don't realize that people look down on us that way.
46604164.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"For example, another place is the bathroom."
46883941.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When I grew up, I always have been informed that if I need to make natural body noise like a fart, burp, etc., the only place that I can do that is in the bathroom."
47065092.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,So I came to view the bathroom as the safe sanctuary for making those kinds of noises.
47133137.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When I enter there, I should be feeling free."
47292363.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,But it's not true. People are still judging there.
47427088.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,It's still a necessity to control how you emit the waste properly.
47609690.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"There's a cultural range, you cannot go in the bathroom and emit waste loudly. People would be horrified. You have to emit the waste gently."
47665653.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,That shows how many noise hangups hearing people have related to that kind of noise.
47845629.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,To the point where some cultures make other noises in the background...
47877712.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When they enter the bathroom and are ready to eliminate waste, they will turn on running water or music to cover up and drown out the bathroom noises."
47904512.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,I know that what happens down there is very taboo to hearing people.
47978474.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,So that's how Deaf people learn.
48119512.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Bill Ennis told a great story about ""bubbles""."
48539771.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"A long time ago, when he was young, he was outside playing basketball and he needed to pee. He ran into the house, saw his mother was on the phone. He ran into the bathroom."
48585083.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He was urinating, and he decided to play around and make bubbles on the toilet."
48629582.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He was making bubbles creatively. After that, he flushed."
48853866.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He went out of the bathroom, and he saw his mother looked so horrified as she was on the phone. He asked her, ""What's wrong?"" She said, ""Oh, you made terrible noises.""  He was surprised about it."
49253789.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"She said, ""You peed on the water, don't do that. You should pee on the bowl of the toilet and avoid water to make it less loud."" He learned from his mother that peeing on the water makes a terrible noise."
49666377.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He was around 15 years old at that time. When he found out, he was disturbed about it. Well, he was lucky, because I know others who didn't come to know about this until much later."
49985301.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"There's a story about a Deaf man who grew up in a hearing family; and the family was not so great with sign language. Every time he went to the bathroom, his parents would react to the loud noise."
50527920.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"His parents tried to tell him to stop. When he came out of the bathroom, his parents would say, ""You piss like a horse."""
50685256.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He wasn't sure what was it meant. He thought that it was a positive thing - that he urinated like a very healthy horse. So he was delighted by his parents' comment.
50748137.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Later, he went to the bathroom again. His mother made the same remark: ""You piss like a horse."""
50787137.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He was pleased with the remark. His parents gave up about it and left him alone.
51252152.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He grew up, he entered college, and he met a hearing CODA woman. He started to like her, and he was around his early to mid 20's at that time."
51694177.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"They went out on a date. When they got home, he went to the bathroom, and the CODA woman heard him. When he got out, she told him, ""You piss like a horse."""
51764495.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He was shocked because she used the same line as his parents when he was growing up.
51779354.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He said, ""pissing like a horse is good."" She said, ""No! It's awful.  It's very loud."""
51835847.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"He said, ""Oh really, what is it?"" She said, ""you urinated on the toilet water, and you should switch to the surface bowl of the toilet to avoid noise."" He was embarrassed from girlfriend during that time."
52287944.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He was very embarrassed.  He realized that he wasn't clear on his parents' remarks when he was growing up. He gulped hard. He changed his habits to urinate on the side of the bowl.
52344305.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,He married that woman and lived happily ever after.
53259686.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"So, I was thinking about this.  Is the bathroom itself a safe sanucatory?  Not necessarily, because hearing people who enter the bathroom can still hear people nearby."
39918381.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"If someone were to make a loud noise, they would be looked down upon as no good, having no class, and being impolite."
40013479.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,They made a judgment in the bathroom. Judgment is carried out in the bathroom.
40214885.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,My hearing colleague here at Gallaudet University. He told me that he could identify which Deaf or hearing person in the public bathroom as they're in the stall based on how they emit the waste.
40670695.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"Hearing people control the noise when emitting waste, whereas Deaf people emit waste loudly. I was like, ""Ohh."""
40782206.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,What does it mean if a person emits waste loudly?  There is actually a long list of cultural items that are related to the control of sound.
41237458.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"If a person emits waste loudly, without controlling the noise, it shows the person isn't polite. There is a long list of implicit cultural rules that apply to the Deaf, when they, obliviously, enter the bathroom."
41262439.mp4,8-Ben-Control-of-sound-places,"When I grew up, I was told that a bathroom is a safe place. It's not true anymore."
